It's full of... socks?
You can't even wash them. There isn't any soap.
Can't... turn... away...
This toaster looks like a champion.
About the right size for a head.
Turn on the stove? Yes No
Great now it's a fire hazard.
Everything in here has gone bad.
Collect the trash? Yes No
Garbage mountain once stood here.
Obtained a can of Viking Feast brand dog food.
Nice! That's my favorite one!
Nothing to put in the bowl.
Feed Baron the Viking Feast? Yes No
Feed Baron some of the Garbage? No! Yes, I am a terrible person.
Feed Baron? Viking Feast Garbage
The glorious Viking Feast pours from the can into Baron's bowl. It has little axe shaped meats in it.
I always wanted to be a viking. They're so cool.
Heh, I'm sure. Hurry up so we can get going.
I'm already done!
What?! How did you finish so fast?
WITH VIKING POWER!!! Let's go finish our adventure!
He made really quick work of that.
The garbage slumps into Baron's bowl with a disappointing wet sound.
Hey... That's pretty messed up Lore...
I didn't expect this from you...
The sickening mush glistens in the bowl.
Hey! Where are you going? Don't leave yet...
Don't do this to me... Come back with that!
The can is over on the counter. I would open it myself but... paws and stuff.
I'm ready! What's the flavor of the day?
OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH
Still need to grab the garbage.
It won't turn on...
Well at least it isn't a fire hazard now.
He's not here...
What was I thinking...?
Looks like the power is still on. That's good at least.
Things are looking up for our brave adventurers.
Heh, I guess you're right. Let's press on you silly mutt.
Mutt?! How rude!
That lightswitch frying must have killed the power...
Must have died while I was outside.
Must have died during the night.
