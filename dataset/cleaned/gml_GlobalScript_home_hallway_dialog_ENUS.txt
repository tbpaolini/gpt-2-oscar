Damn, he must be up.
That's ok, maybe he's in a good mood today?
Hey kiddo, the kitchen trash is overflowing. Go take it out would you?
Hey maroon, the kitchen trash is overflowing. Go take it out. 
Problem solved! That wasn't so bad right?
Always the optimist... At least it's just the trash.
Definitely don't want to go in there.
This broken painting clearly depicts a slayer of champions.
Last one there's a rotten egg!
Too much water and not enough sun. Just like the rest of this place.
That plant looks kind of sad. It clearly needs an adventure.
No more adventures for this warrior.
What could have made these...?
The door is jammed... It's not even strawberry...
You may have an axe but, this isn't that kind of game.
Don't you have anything better to do?
Maybe we should go?
What did I just say? Don't make me come out there.
Lore...?
Well I guess that solves that problem...
Looks like the power is still on. That's good at least.
Things are looking up for our brave adventurers.
Heh, I guess you're right. Let's press on you silly mutt.
Mutt?! How rude!
That lightswitch frying must have killed the power...
Must have died while I was outside.
Must have died during the night.
