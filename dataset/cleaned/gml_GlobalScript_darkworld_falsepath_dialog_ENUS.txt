Go then.
See where hope takes you.
Take the axe? Yes No
Hurt it.
Make it pay.
You're right.
You aren't strong enough.
You're already out for blood.
What are you waiting for?.
It feels good.
Knowing what you did.
What kind of person you are.
You weren't there for him.
Now he's gone.
You thought you could just read my thoughts?.
Search through my memories like this?.
STRINGS will only get you so far.
Don't give up. Not now. Not yet.
You can do this. Just a little farther.
This wasn't what I wanted. Not like this.
Everything is going to be ok. Just keep moving.
You can't run this time.
He's not coming back.
You failed him.
It's your fault.
You did this.
You found a shadowy sock. Sneaky!
