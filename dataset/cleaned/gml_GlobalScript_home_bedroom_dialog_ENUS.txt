Going back to bed seems like a bad idea.
There we go, all set to battle the day.
No need to get dressed a second time.
Boof... Boof...
He's out like a light.
Yikes! Lore?! Are you ok buddy?
I think so... The lightswitch is toast though.
I'm going to head back to bed. This day is already sour enough.
Wait... What about breakfast?
Dude... it's too early for food.
It's never too early for food! Where is your sense of adventure?
Sleeping, like we should be.
You know I can't open the can...
Oh fine... let's get going then. Your fault if anything else goes wrong.
Baron isn't even awake yet.
Might want to grab your sweater before we go. It should be in your dresser.
You really can't be thinking about going in your pajamas, can you?
Not my monkey, not my circus. Whatever you want to do I got your back.
The storm outside is getting rough.
Go back to sleep? Yes No
Already fast asleep.
There's a huge slash across the back...
It's too stormy to see anything...
