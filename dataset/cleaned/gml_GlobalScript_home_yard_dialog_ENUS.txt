Throw out the garbage? Yes No
Throw something out? Garbage Viking Feast
The garbage fills the trashcan to the top.
The vikings have slain the GARBAGE MONSTER!
Hah, yeah. You make a great viking yaknow.
Thanks! You make a decent one yourself.
Just decent?
Alright you make a great viking.
Haha, that's much better.
The garbage beast of legend was slain here by two brave vikings.
So you do know where garbage is supposed to go after all...
It's filled with garbage.
The Viking Feast pours from the can into the trashcan. A tiny axe shaped meat clings to the side of the bin.
Why would you do that...? Has it really gotten that bad?
This isn't like you... It can't be...
The Viking Feast brand dog food sits gloomily at the bottom of the trashcan.
Denied its destiny the trashcan recoils in sadness.
Hey Lore?
Yeah what's up?
Just wanted to say... I had a really good time today.
Yeah me too. Let's head back to bed, alright?
Sounds good buddy.
Hey Lore?
Yeah what's up?
Today seemed kind of off... Is everything alright?
Yeah... Sorry for being a maroon...
That's alright... We can both be maroons sometimes. Let's get back to bed, ok?
Hey Lore?
Yes?
You're kind of scaring me... Is everything ok?
Of course. Why do you ask?
N... no reason...
Take the axe? Yes No
Getting ready for a Viking LARP? I won't judge you...
Strike fear into the hearts of trees and terrors alike.
Baron's Collar...
He must be close by...
Don't worry buddy... I'm on my way...
It's torn to shreds... Blood for blood...
It's torn to shreds...  
You found a wet sock. Slimy!
