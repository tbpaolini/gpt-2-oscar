======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 them you know... right?
Alright... hand me the watch and lets get crackin'!
Just sit back, relax, and watch me work my magic.
So... how long is it going to take?
As long as it takes.
What...?
You'll see it...
What if I don't take care of myself?
Then it's a success?
No...
Then I don't have much of a choice...
The machine is crooning...
You're totally right... just stop and think about how you got so attached.
It's my fault... I got... problems with my temper.
I... I don't know how...
Good. Embrace that helpless feeling.
Just give it a shot?
You're wasting time.
We need to leave.
Heck yeah! Gale needs to leave.
Uh...
What should we do with the other guy?
We don't have any employees and are not under the control of any one employee.
Well that's assuming you're realistic.
Shouldn't it be?
In fact...
Would you rather have Lore defect than give in to pressure from outside influences.
You... did a good job. Let's go.
Hey, thanks.
A few moments of silence.
A few seconds of feedback.
None so nothing...
You think I'm kidding?
I just... don't know what to say.
Sorry...
Don't worry about it. My name is Terry and I'm the head of the IT department.
Yes?
Yes?
It's... bestial.
You'll need to find a more experienced worker.
There are many... options.
None of them involve as much as you think they will.
They're all ineffective at helping you succeed.
That's not a bad thing.
What to do?
Take the apple? No Yes
No.
What if I don't have a job open?
That's a bad idea.
I know.
What if I don't have a manager?
That's a very bad idea.
We can both be wrong.
But one way or the other.
We can all agree on one thing.
Good job, Intern. Time for the board game!
AME AIN'T TURNED ON CRATER!
Yeah what's up?
I love you.
I love you too, Intern.
Hurry up, Newhire. Are you ready for what comes next.
Actually... we need to get going.
Well I mean you did just haul everyone's stuff.
Thanks for all that's hers.
You're always doing the talking. Always talking about the company.
Well... yeah I guess.
What do you mean?
You really brought this on yourself.
You've got a mean streak in you.
You know where all your weak points are.
You know where all your weak points are.
There's a lot that's worth it when family is on the line.
Time for a new job!
What do you mean by that?
You're a huge nerd.
You're a big nerd.
Family isn't on the agenda here.
I never was a nerd!
You suck.
Family plays a huge role in who you are.
Even if you are not totally dysfunctional.
You really are a bad person.
Dad is kind of a jerk but he's right anyway.
I'm a chameleon.
You're a ZOMBIE!
Yeah me neither!
Err... but I'm a chameleon.
You're a man... animal.
I'm a giant... and you're a monster.
So what do you have on me?
A little clause to keep me safe while I continue to attack you.
A bunch of letters written by a lonely man.
You don't know what you're talking about.
The inside of a medical marijuana grow pen.
A weird assortment of seeds and cash.
Filled with strange liquid.
A sticky note telling the patient your side of the story.
No surprises.
Here we go!
Can you feel them?
They're growing in here.
A few places you wouldn't expect them to be.
Pens on the side are painful.
You pat yourself on the back for accepting men like that.
There's a book in here. 'Nuff said.
Front page camera lens rolled out the side.
Hey! Come check it out!
Don't want a record of my adventures?
I come check it out. Come check it out.
Hey! Come check it out.
Hey! Come check it out.
<|endoftext|>Hey! Come check it out.
Hurry up, Newhire. We're a SWAT team.
Well I mean... we're
