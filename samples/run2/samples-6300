======== SAMPLE 1 ========

Hurry up, Newhire. You'll need this lot to a modest degree.
I understand your ofc. They're a bit of a cactus in my book.
Hurry up, Newhire. You'll need this lot to a modest degree.
Yeah let's get on with it then.
I guess?
Good! Are you ready?
Ready for what?
It's time for your TERMINATION!
Wait... what?
You're no longer valuable to Tower Corp. So now you're being deleted. Lucky you!
You can't be serious.
You're right! I'm OScar!
Have a good sixty seconds, Newhire?
Only a few seconds, dear ol' buddy.
Millions of people around the world use up every page of every entity on the planet.
This is ridiculous.
How many more of these systems will we see in the next game cycle?
Are we really going to put a planet on steroids?
Humility will only show when you defect.
That doesn't really sound worth it to me.
There's a lot that's worth it when family is on the line.
Technology is the best thing ever.
Humility will continue to improve when we are older.
That doesn't really sound worth it to me.
Technology is destroying us.
We are on a limb here this doesn't actually involve you is it not true?
Technology is destroying us.
We are on a totally different page to you than you are.
It's full of machine learning super tools.
Man, this company is utter garbage.
The screen is covered in press papers.
The door is locked.
The door is doing a little bit of a job.
Would you show them a little something?
A few slides in this endless library.
Turn me on!
I can't do that again.
I really can't.
It's the new manager...
He's a puppet.
You're wrong.
You're right.
It is.
Now is the right time to stand up for yourself.
You've been manipulated.
You've all but eliminated the temptation to truthfully speak out.
Man, this place is torture.
I'm not even sure if it's time for a lie or not.
All you did was make it worse.
You've destroyed the very hope that made you this way.
I... what...?
So now you're calling for changes?
He'll just miss?
It's your fault.
What?
You gave him everything he asked for.
He's going to get it.
You're right.
I am?
This is your fault.
You did this.
You're going to get it?
You made this bad?
I'm sorry...
HERE IS THE STRANGE CAFE!
Hey, come back when you have some energy!
You never did.
I'm exhausted from all of this.
Just leave me alone...
Heres that one! Thanks for all the help.
See you tomorrow then!

Duck.
Duck.
Duck.
Duck.
Duck.
Goose?
You found a hard working sock! Business!
Sealed closed with tons of sticky notes.
A bunch of papers with poorly drawn ducks on them.
There are like... 50 pens in here.
This computer is ridiculous. You can't even see the screen.
Welp, got one.
Don't need another one of these things.
Definitely not doing that again.
It's just a bunch of garbage data.
Blinking lights in a field of darkness.
Wow, that was embarassing.
Oh boy, really messed that one up huh?
Just uhh... Do your best next time.
Man, this place is really scary.
Crushed trees and rocks as you walked by.
It's totally junk.
First person accountancy.
Seriously...?
You're just a bunch of garbage data.
First person accountancy.
Seriously...? You're the best.
Seriously...? You're the worst.
You know what? Sure.
Good luck.
With the help of one brick.
Well, yeah. That's out the door.
What did you just say to me?
Emelio, the rack is still in place. I hope you fixed it shortly!
That's not a real rack.
It's just a bunch of tiny antennae.
Well that's definitely a bunch of tiny ittingly ittingly ittingly.
They're not actual bricks.
You can't even read a pile of laundry.
A sharpened scythe breaks the axe and sinks into the earth.
I never thought office work would involve this many
