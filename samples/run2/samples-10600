Let's go home?
Yes and I will be attending other matters.
Go ahead and give me a cookie, I'm sure you'll.
Alright, see you around.
Wait... what?
Oh... Sorry...

<|endoftext|>Hey, Newhire.
You know, you're really not supposed to be here.

<|endoftext|>There is a jar of red pickles in here. Pickles are gross! I love pickles!
A single giant eraser sits in the drawer. The word 'pencil' is printed neatly on the side.

A sock note is pinned to the board. Informative!
The handle rattles but the door remains unmoved.
A small keypad is stuck to the desk.
Where... Where am I...?
Baron...? Are you here...?
Dude... no.
A jar of nasties sits neatly in the drawer.
The jar of pickles evaporates.
The drawer lays empty and pickleless.
A picture of a pirate is in here. It has some strange writing on it. Lavender Beard
