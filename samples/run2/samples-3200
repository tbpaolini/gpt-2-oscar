...... You are right.
All of this power helped me survive the day.
Yet I would not do it alone.
Even if it meant going against the grain.
It isn't my place to choose myself, dear brother.
Why should others have to pick between them or themselves?
You will understand when the time comes.
It may prove more than you can see.
We know this place because of you.
We follow our destiny.
We protect it with malice.
Perhaps you will too.
We are not watchdogs or guardians.
You are instead far too kind to meet the expectations of others.
I have no doubt in your mind's power.
It is you who is wrong.
I know that you are right.
It may well be right.
We may all be wrong.
Yet it still guides me in the right direction.
I believe in you.
It may be right.
It may be right.
It may be right.
It may be right.
It may be right.
Thank you.

I am that third party diagnostic technician.
Please stop.
I do not accept your honesty.
I will not let you have it.
No more...
More of the same.
This way of doing things feels strange to most.
I follow the path of least resistance.
The power is up and I'm looking to win.
Don't worry about it. I'm just saying that if you like it keep an eye on the settings.
I set the phone to sleep and then wake up and look around.
It's fine.
I know how rough things can get.
It is.
It can be... wrong.
It's going to have to change that soon.
Sure...
Good.
<|endoftext|>Something nasty is going on.
This door is squeamish.
A strange assortment of junk and broken items.

Hey, you. I-It's Link. Kind of kills my featherweight title, but that's no reason to worry.
I'm in luck, Emelio. You willing to help me find the beautiful flower?
I'm honored to be a part of the adventure, Emelio. -The Lore Leader
Hello, Link. The hero of my story.
Does this sound familiar?
It's the first time I know anyone, Binder.
What kind of place...?.
It's haunted. People say it looks spooky.
This door is squeamish.
A squeaky clean acronym. I've read that.
A WHOLE SPECK in that word...!
It's a ledger. That's all it is.
How do you write that?
A book with a lot of words. I read a lot and it's called 'The Intelligent Life Graph.'
A bunch of ants buzzing around here.
It's a small room with awnings broken into.
This ant is mostly just breaking and trotting.
It's a beautiful red headed monster.
They say the calming watercolor ink is the best.
A bunch of flowers withered out here.
This axe is so cute it's holding a baby.
It's a red monster.
She's so cute she knows everything.
You can't be serious.
Everything is colored pink.
You survive alone forever.
I'm not joking.
You're joking is not valid.
You actually got what you deserved.
It's a painting of a forest in autumn.
You look silly.
I'm sorry, Artie.
Of course.
Well, you're on your own.
How about we go talk to in the woods?
Are you serious?
Sure...
Are you ready for what comes next?
It's a club... kind of one of the birds.
Time to get out of here.
Sit back, relax, and don't listen.
This thing is real.
Hey, you okay?
Yeah... I'm fine.
You just need to know that you're to blame.
You aware criminalships are false.
Clarity brings clarity.
Correct.
So... I'm telling you, Shatterfear is real.
