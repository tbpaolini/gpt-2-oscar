======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 manager with a bow drawn. That doesn't really wood...
A lump of cold metal.
You've doomed Tower Corp with your foolish decisions.
I'm not even sure if you noticed.
That's not real.
<|endoftext|>Wh... what...?
Come back with that! I need it replaced.
It's only awkward if you make it awkward.
I wonder what aesthetic would work best.
Forget about it. AREN'T REAL!!!
Uhh... sure.
Let's get back to bed then.
Uhh... time for a day job.
You can't replace the brutal cycle of work with witty jokes.
Yes I can. It takes a little getting used to.
Take a break? Yes No
Disgusting device. Strange how some things can take years.
Disgusting device. You survived.
You're not ready.
What is this?
It's a box.
How do you know my name?
I'm the head of the Inhumane Resources department. It's my job to know.
You don't have the answers to her questions.
Maybe you should give her advice.
You should be telling the truth.
You're a bad person.
You're a bad person. I'm sorry.
It's too late for me.
How do you know my name?
It's her. She first met you when you walked by them.
And then came after you.
Why do you have to keep going?
It feels good.
You decide to help her.
What...?
It's just a box.
I... it's not real.
Now that you say something constructive it can't be good.
This helps to show the way.
Does this really needs to be said?
I hope you like it anyway!
<|endoftext|>Uhh... hey there.
Where am I...?
You're in my... shop? Let's call it a shop.
Is it a shop or are you calling it a shop?
Yes.
It's you, but with a beard.
That's the beard mirror!
Beard... mirror?
It grants special powers to anyone who dare gaze into it.
What kind of powers?
Beard... powers?
It's you, but with beard powers.
This clock doesn't seem to be working.
That's not a clock it's a kcolc!
What did you just say to me?
It takes time... instead of telling it.
That sounds kind of terrifying.
It has its uses.
Better keep away from this thing.
Shelves of books written in strange symbols.
Those are my spell boo... I mean my finance records.
Finance records?
Yes.
Right here out in the open?
Yes...
Where anyone can see them?
Y... yes.
Shelves of 'finance records' written in strange symbols.
It's a terrifying scythe.
I use that to fell powerful monsters!
What kind of monsters...?
You know... the monstery kind.
A scythe used to fell powerful monsters.
Full of secrets and untold treasures.
Nothing to see there!
It's a chest.
Nope definitely not!
What kind of game doesn't let you open a chest?
This kind!
It won't even open. It's a solid block of metal.
A set of potions sit perfectly balanced and unmoving.
Are these for sale?
No.
Is anything for sale?
Maybe.
Is this even a real shop?
Are you even a real person?
Snag a potion? Left Middle Right NO WAY!
I saw that.
Saw what?
You took that potion.
What if I'm going to buy it?
You're not going to buy it.
You're right.
One of the potions is missing.
The potions sit here as proof of your honorable nature.
The beautiful houseplant lays motionless in the void.
Something catch your eye?
Yeah, this houseplant...
Everything alright?
Just a memory of something that could have been.
It hurts to look at so you look away.
Hey... can you talk to me from the other side of the table?
Seriously...
If you can't find anything you should just go.
<|endoftext|>Hey Newhire! Miss me?
Uhh... Yeah, sure.
Good! Are you ready?
Ready for what?
It's time for your TERMINATION!
Wait... what?
You're no longer valuable to Tower Corp. So now you're being deleted. Lucky you!
You can't be serious.
You're right! I'm OScar!
Have a good sixty seconds
