<|endoftext|>This is the ending.
It will not change the fact that I'm Prime.
My name is Terry. Terry Stumpf. Prime was my...
It is almost over. Let's keep going.
I never thought office work would involve this many people.
Not enough energy, not enough... work.
Less than all of you.
Terry is dead.
They all were... in place... He was just... apart...
You feel bad about his absence... He died to protect you.
None of this does.
The problem is... it wasn't yours.
He's gone... and nobody can stop him.
Everything you did here you did for nothing.
You lost... and now I'm not you...
<|endoftext|>Dad... I don't know what you wanted here...
I should have stuck with my son.
He was my best friend for years. Even then he was flawed.
I stole his blood type data. I've since verified this to be correct.
This is his sparky blood type data. It says he's got a tiny smudg...
That's not enough... It's blanched...
It's not bark... It's jacked...
It's just a stick...
<|endoftext|>Dad... I don't know what you wanted here...
I should have stuck with my son.
He was a terrible enemy.
I stole his data. I've since verified this to be correct.
This is his sparky blood type data. It says he's got a tiny smudg...
That's not enough... It's blanched...
It's not bark... It's jacked...
It's not just a stick...
A bunch of junk data. You find... terrors don't come with my cougar.
There's a terrors original.
Copy that? Yes No
I see where you're going. I know you're there.
You're right.
It's just a stick...
A bunch of garbage data. You come fight for your job.
We stole those heaters from here.
We need to get rid of the lights.
Catch ya soon.
<|endoftext|>Hey, dad.
Fern...?
Yes, we are?
This is very hard to believe.
We are?
Great. Here we go.
Take my flash drive. Write down what you're looking at. Engrave the names of the places I just fell on terrible margins.
Alright, that was... accurate.
Just... don't do it.
You'll understand when you see it.
It won't be the same.
We're friends.
It's just a bunch of garbage data.
You'll never see it.
It fades out.
You never knew.
It might resurface.
This way.
There are other parties to this story.
All of them are real.
All of them are so very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very.
We all came to share this awful thing called truth.
We all did.
We all did it anyway.
We all have your back.
Except for you.
You're not real.
<|endoftext|>Hey, dad.
I know you're hurting.
But don't worry about it.
I'll be right here by... in... your... hair.
A toothpick. A dream.
A vivid one.
No more painful memories of this day.
Give it a shot? It's free.
You might just find something you like.
<|endoftext|>Hey, dad.
I know you're hurting.
But don't worry about it.
I'll be right here by... in... your... hair.
A toothpick. A dream.
A trio of bones.
They don't exist to you.
None of them are real.
<|endoftext|>Hey, dad.
I know you're hurting.
But don't worry about it.
I'll be right here by... in... your... hair.
