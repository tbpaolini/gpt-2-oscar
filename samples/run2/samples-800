======== SAMPLE 1 ========
. You are still alive.
Now let's leave this for next time.
I know you would.
Just...
Don't do it again.
It's not my place to do so.
All that hesitation and work has done nothing to make this dark place that is Beacon come to life.
All that effort and work has paid off.
It's almost time for work.
Just so you know, CodeAmber. You hate taking breaks.
I should have paid more attention.
I would have paid for more time.
It's too bad you don't have work to do at the office.
I'm afraid so. You can blame my choice not to feel the urge.
Errors can be made in others moments before they happen.
I am. Your response shows.
Thank you, Erina.
But how do I make sure Erinas spends time with family?
By hiring a private tour company to take him to all of them.
You are wrong. He cannot see into it.
What should he do with that money?
I... He can't. I'm not going to tell him that.
What?
What?
Well, that's a good question.
I could go on that page, Erina.
Okay...
Good. The tour.
A good tour.
1. Be careful out there.
2. Human trafficking is real.
3. They're coming after you.
Hey, stop them.
Maybe.
Find another spot. Better leave.
Why not?.
No...
You don't want to be a robot.
Stay home. Don't cry.
Maybe.
These aren't real family. They could be real people.
All wrapped up in paperwork. Much more focused on the job.
It's all too real to look at. There's a lot to be made of this way.
There's a impressive array of medical supplies and tools on this farm.
The path ahead of them is dangerous and can be dangerous.
Always be on the look out for suspicious activity.
Are youlying?... ?
Always keep an eye on the farm as you work.
Always have a scythe in hand when you are not out running.
Hauling can be a bit of a journey this season.
Be careful out of sharing. Foes may flock at the seams.
A scythe accidently jacks onto the farm.
Mobius... What are you, my regular FET?!
My name is Bo... I'm the Farm... You're almost there, aren't you!
... You know, I should be thanking you.
Hah, quick...
Hang in there! What are you doing here? Keep your cool!
 The cougar chases after you.
This cougar is doing pretty well. They are taking almost all of our revenue!
They are taking in... nothing!
We don't need them!
Oh really?
Of course we.
You're welcome!
Well... I think I finished.
A big meaty throat.
Baron's Throat [Female only].e...
I'm not quite sure if that's the curse or the curse of the throat.
I know, obvious... But my name was just a pun on his full name.
He always sounds like him.
That's not true. He's just saying it.
Yeah just not quite right yet.
Your name always sounds like full name home.
Yeah just not quite right yet.
I feel bad about it... I really did sound like home.
Yeah just not quite right yet.
Yeah I really do...
It feels like home.
...Home...
Home...
Home...
I Feel Bad... Allowed...
Baron's Throat [Female Only].e...
Yeah... That's pretty messed up.
You know... I'm sorry...
I... Whatever.
Look... I understand.
What is this place called?
Just... the couch.
Just a bunch of tired, fuzzy stuff.
You can't even put a backlit tag over them.
It looks like something would break...
Is this it?
Or am I supposed to be monitoring this?

A lot of these stairs just seem to be made out of up and down. All of the different finishes are made out of downforce. All of the different finishes are made out of steel.
