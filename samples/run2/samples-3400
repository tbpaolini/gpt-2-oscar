======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 object. I don't care how awesome your creation is.
The ink sinks into the page and fades out.
That's not so bad...
What if I'm wrong?
Not if you're right...
I'm sorry...
Why not?
You could always try: brainin' with a fist is risky
I amstra, Emelio. I can assure you that you will be ok under any of the following scenarios:
The path I choose isn't ready for the thing to go.
I then oversee the flow of data between the brain and the screen.
This seems perfectly fine from the start.
The experience is lost as the experience is gained at the screen.
This thing seems inclined to make sense of what's happened.
Perhaps I'm mistaken.
However, you are most correct that I'm in direct violation of the Unspoken ethical rules.
Aunt Phoo Bitches Feed Baron is BLEEZY!!!
I am, dear brother.
I...
How are you doing...
My name is Terry and I are about to jump ship.
I'm not even blind.
I don't see any...
That's not very wrong.
Don't you realize what I was thinking...?
At the very least, this is your chance.
I would be very respectful and understanding but you've been injured in action.
I've been injured already and I don't even have the strength to stand up for myself.
That's it dear sister.
So... how are you?
I'm doing pretty ok, dear brother.
That's all it is?
I...
What are you doing?
Cousin bout a moment of clarity.
A jarringly familiar memory envelops you.
A familiar and empty room...
The screen fades out and you're in a shadowy place.
The door chugging apologies for the isolation.
Hey, you alright?
Yeah sorry! Just kinda phased out for a minute there.
Sounds alright.
We don't have anything to say anyway.
Thanks.
Alright, what's on your mind?
Something light and stuff. Info open and close.
So... is it like...finished?
It's a lot like...finished but with a little twist.
It feels like...time has altered you.
You can't escape what it means to be a monster.
Don't you mean to tell me you're onto something?
It asks that often.
A little too many times for me to decide what...
That's it.
Enough.
Decisive action is always necessary.
Action is what it should be.
Who created us?
What ends justified this?
To speak of it...
It...
Is unfinished?
I ask now.
What is it?
A simple question that asks the wrong question.
The stone shifts in colour as you try to answer it.
What kind of question it is on a stick?
Is it a stick of dynamite? or a stick of fire?
I want to know.
Record the answer word by word.
That doesn't mean you have to answer it.
I know I can.
How do you know it doesn't belong in the trash?
Tell me.
Is it a stick of dynamite?
IDk what this thing is?
Are you sure?
Sure is yes.
So, would you be nice if we could go see it?
Of course.
Err... no go?
No problem, kid.
Let's go see it.
So you go with me?
Sure...
What about us?"
So we go with you?
Well... you're in my way...
So I see it...
It's not finished...
But it is hard not to be...
So... what are you doing?
What do I amdoing?
What do I do?
You're kind of scaring me...
What have I done...?
I am, my...
But I don't know why.
What do I do?
Guardians handbook
shelves full of advice from the get go...
This isn't right.
It's not real.
What do I want?
Something.
I call it professional advice.
What do I want?
I want to protect the company but I also want to keep my distance from the camera.
That's pretty simple.
I'm out with my best friends.
It's not real.
They're looking at the clock.
Neat, huh?
Keep your distance.
We're living together.
You're not supposed to be here.
What...
Where is it...?
In a place where an intruder could be found?
Why would you leave a child like that at the door?
I won't let them do this.
