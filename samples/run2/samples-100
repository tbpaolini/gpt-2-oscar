======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 whole as if that didn't exist. It's nice to feel.
So, you're the CEO and I want to hear about what I'm doing here.
Wait, what?
That's not what I'm asking?
I want to hear about that?
I wanna share this with you.
Let's leave it at that.
It's the best you can do then.
We're going to start a little bit early so you don't think you're getting to hear everything this time.
That's a little bit.
Yeah.
And why can't we start at once?
Well if I say so myself.
Anyway, let's meet you in person and maybe even talk about our lunch time idea.
See you later.
Well anyway... I really want to spend time with you.
What about you, Chief?
Hey, I guess?
I guess.
I'm glad to see you around...
What can I say?
I love you. I can't tell you much more.
What should I do if I feel bad about something?
We're not talking about you yet.
Alright, well... let's do it. Okay?
You can't leave this place. You can't even move my machine!
No! I'm not.
What? No thanks, boss! I am sorry.
You need to talk to me sometime. I guess.
Hahh...
Are you alright?
Yeah, you sure?
Well yeah, I am sorry. Can I talk to you again?
Nah... I mean I'm pretty nervous. Can we leave this place together...?
Of course! You know how to get to things from different ends of a stranger's mouth? Well, don't worry about it. I promise we won't let you know that anyway.
I'll just head out.
Let's leave this place alone. Here's the thing...
It's a bit too crowded for this environment.
It's not what I wanted here.
That's all I have to say.
Hey, did you need this already? How about this?
Yeah, that's right, I guess.
You're a genius. Your name is...
...Chief Bitch?! You're right, Chief... We're still trying to find the right guy here.
He's here.
Why didn't you say anything?!
No... I mean... what...?
No... This place isn't mine...
We're only here for this.
We can't leave him anymore.
You must not leave him alone.
Alright, fine. If you want to leave, I don't think you have a second.
That's fine.
No need to leave. I'll leave.
Alright then... Let's leave...
...
Wait... what?
What...? I mean... what...?
What if something comes up.
What if he...
I mean... What if someone goes over and hits me...?
I mean... What if everything goes as it should?
It's the wrong idea if nobody comes to rescue them. Don't worry. Let's get right back to work, shall we?
I hope you're enjoying yourself.
What is this...? Is that how everyone treats you?
Not with the proper kind of attention.
Are you sure...? Can we leave like this?
Of course, but... Let's leave this place alone.
Alright... Alright... Sorry about the long waiting around... There...
Just let me ask you a question...
Just who was this guy...?
Uh oh, uh...
He's an old acquaintance of mine.
He wasn't here long for such an unusual offer.
You're always late.
How do I know that?
It's just a question.
I always ask it for my old friend.
I always tell him what he wants to know.
It's not that I mean to try and hide him...
Why are you telling me that?
How do you know what I want to know?
Well...
Just now...
It's me.
We're not going anywhere.
How do you know if I want to follow your path?
Well...
I just don't know for sure!
You're right... Let's leave this place alone and hope for the best...
You don't know what you want to do.
You don't know what you want to do.
You understand.
You've thought that.
I guess you can ask anything.
Fine... We'll get back to work.
Let's go, boss!
That sounds good... Come back soon...
Don't do anything!
That's not how it works out.
Now that I think about it...
This is your first time working in the company. You're a man of high morals and this is no different.
You
