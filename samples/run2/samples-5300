======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 asked, this is it.
<|endoftext|>Look at you.
Destroying everything in your path.
You'll never find him.
You'll never see him again.
Leave him there.
He deserves this.
You'll always be pathetic.
You could be so much more.
She was right about you.
They all were.
However.
It won't matter.
They're coming.
That's enough.
Show them your strength.
No more hesitation.
It will be over soon.
You need to wake up sometime.
I SAID THAT'S ENOUGH!!!
Your choice.
It's glowing like the sun. Look inside. Take a minute.
Going to try again?
Last cycle worked out so well for it.
It's not real... This isn't happening...
Typical &1_12345&0_.
Dear brother, handle this one won't you?
It isn't my place to handle this nor is it yours, dear sister.
I expected nothing less.
You know my nature as I know yours.
It's very persistent.
Always pushing forward. Never stopping.
This isn't happening...
Poor sweet, &1_12345&0_.
Don't give up. Keep going.
It isn't your place to choose, dear brother.
You are regretfully correct, dear sister.
It must forge its own path.
Who... are you?
It doesn't know.
That is the way of things.
A damaged vessel?
Give it time. We shall test it.
I'm not here to play games.
A strong response.
A strong response.
Agreed. Decisive and straight forward.
A proper path even if this one is damaged.
It set about helping him then followed through in his time of need.
We approve.
Yes we do.
Yet lacking conviction.
It doesn't follow through.
It left him there. In the darkness. Alone.
Morality is irrelevant.
Agreed, dear brother. Decisive action will lead to results.
Unfortunate, dear sister. It chose to help him then left him anyway.
Without a set path it will falter when the time comes.
We shall see.
We shall.
Yet it can't make a decision when it matters.
It set to help him.
Then left him in the dark.
Then chose to help him instead.
All mixed up.
Lost in choice.
Yet it has no follow through.
It lacks conviction.
It helped him to escape the dark.
Yet it wanted to leave him there.
Decisive action is what matters most, dear sister.
It's not ready, dear brother.
It either will be or won't be. We are here to observe.
Let us wait for it to conclude.
Yet it lacks compassion.
Morality is irrelevant, dear brother.
Agreed, dear sister. Decisive action is what matters.
Unfortunate, dear sister. It chose to leave him in the dark.
Yet it wanted to leave him there.
An obedient and powerful vessel.
We approve.
Yes we do.
Yet it's plagued with indecision.
It set out to find a dark secret.
A way out? A sister?
In order to leave the path?
In order to win back the favor?
It set out to seductively take control.
A natural response, dear sister.
It set out to seductively take over.
In order to obtain the food?
In order to obtain the food?
It wanted to help him.
It wanted to help himself.
All mixed up.
It chose a path that failed.
It set out to fail.
In order to fail?
In order to satisfy it?
In order to be right?
<|endoftext|>There's a small key in your pocket. It feels greasy!
There's a familiar book given to you by your ancestor. It's title says 'How to Prepare a Dwarf In a Jar of Beans'.
It's full of crude drawings of exquisite books.
The familiar book hands tremble at the pages.
It's full of crude drawings of exquisite drawings of exquisite books.
You're weak.
You can fight back.
It's full of propaganda.
The object of this propaganda is to subject humans to propaganda.
This is your chance.
You will do what you are told.
I understand.
That will not happen.
This is your chance.
Make it happen.
I have little hope of it.
I cannot prove it to you otherwise.
I will explain when it's over.
This will be the best for for now.
Neither you nor I can guarantee
