 a bunch of bank transfer statements. All of his money is going to an off-tower account.
That's not enough cash for an IT job.
The price for it was pretty high...
Well it must have taken an IT job for that to happen.
Ahh... I'm off to explore a more natural looking environment.
Presently I'm working on a cacti suit. It looks fantastic.
I'm looking quite the bit here right now.
I would be very thankful for that... but I'm not getting a Job WTA job.
Ok... thanks.
A large red stone blocks your path.
I... I see you met Shortstack. JOB EATIN' DANG EM DEES!!!
That's not gonna happen...
A strange looking cacti are growing in the sand.
These cacti are super fancy.
They lack their signature bowties to really show off though.
Fancy cacti bowties only grow in the rainy season.
That's a FACT!
A couple of bowtie-less cacti are growing in the sand.
Pour the potion onto the cacti? Yes No
The strange potion replenishes the fancy cacti.
They immediately sprout dashing bowties.
You quickly pocket a bowtie. The cactus doesn't mind.
The fancy cacti stand proud in their enclosure.
A WHOLE SLED OF NOPES!!!
You know... moles can't actually see in the dark.
Yeah well, neither can I.
Do you have an endgame here or...?
Nah...
Just gonna leave this alone.
Good for you.
Second cousin booktower is really far from home.
A medium pile of books.

Better leave this alone for now.
Come check it out, dude!

The gear mechanism should work now.
It's still not moving...
Maybe it's not TIME for it to move yet?
I mean... It IS kind of trashed.
Yeah, I guess you're right...
Well... don't give up yet.
You've got all the TIME in the world to fix this thing.
Well I mean... The hands are obviously broken.
Yeah, I just thought...
You thought you'd have an easier TIME fixing it?
Well I mean... The wood is kind of scuffed but the rest is fine.
Shouldn't it work then?
It looks like it's gone through a lot.
Maybe you should give it some TIME.
Why are you like this...
Because if I was any other way it wouldn't be as fun.
True.
Also... Don't worry about the watch.
I'm sure Shelly can fix it.
Who?
What are you, an owl?
Maybe.
Anyway... Shelly lives east of the lake.
Tell her husband I said WASSUP. He hates that.
Why would I want to make him mad?
You'll understand when you meet him.
You should get going. I got stuff to do.
Oh man... I gotta get rid of this thing.
Wait... did he just... MOVE?!
Nah. Couldn't be.
OH MAN HE TOTALLY MOVED!!!

Nice.
I've still got my eye on you though.
I can't even see your eyes...
That makes two of us.
Seriously?
Yep.
Fine... I believe you.
You do?
Yep.
Why?
If you really ate brains you'd be way smarter.
Ok... you're obviously not a zombie.
