======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 life a little differently.
Don't you?
Who?
What did you have in mind?
A few things I like the most.
Less fuss. Time to clean up after this thing.
It's getting dark. We're in the middle of nowhere.
How do you even begin to tell me where the sun is?
Heavily obscured memories of when you were a baby.
Blistering sands and rainbows as you wander the countryside.
<|endoftext|>Hey kid.
I know you're not allowed to do anything illegal.
I did what?
Just say no.
Tell me more...
I will!
The ball is rolled?
No?
Well, it looks like it.
The football is thrown?
No?
Did you hit the ball?
No, not really.
It's just a ball.
It's just a ball.
That's it?
Get back on the field.
I really think you need to hear this one.
SYNOPSIS...
That meant much to me.
To think how someone like you would feel after all this time.
I am sorry...
I didn't mean to cause any trouble.
We can get back on track together someplace.
Of course...
Of course...
Ow... Ow... Ow...
BAM!
There we go! That's enough!
Stairwell away...
I won't notice...
Nothing out of the ordinary... I'm just stylist for you...
Wait... What?
Don't worry about it.
Oh yeah... Don't forget about me.
Yeah sure...
Do you need anything further?
Just a word?
Wait... You're out of memory?
Yes me.
Hrm...
Don't worry about it.
Yeah sure...
1. Get out of my way.
2. Come near and feel the distance.
Yes ma'am.
Seeya.
<|endoftext|>Finally caught up to you.
Damn you, you're like... new never this way.
You're pretty good though.
Even in my power I'm not good.
Poor kid.
Look... Sheer indecision.
Into the recesses.
You didn't move.
No...
You did not bark.
It's my fault.
Why do you have such a habit of it?
You'll understand when you get your chance.
This isn't like you...
You wanted to hurt her.
This is about the girls.
The problem is...
NEET ARE THEY DANG HOT!!!
Did you just throw a shoe?
Nah.
Wait...
Hang in there! You're signature.
Yes!
AKA 'Shoot first, silly brother.'
Seriously?
Yeah... I guess?
Notice the way he's always handled you.
Have you noticed someone else?
No...
What...?
Everyone I know is Kobe. I'm the guy who threw you off a cliff.
Wow...
What...?
You looking pretty defeated?
That's pretty absurd.
What defiance would dare?
Destruction...
You wouldn't recognize it.
This is what I wanted.
When I was a kid, I crime-raped the nyc.
I don't think I deserved that...
You're probably right.
How about when you 6-years-old?
How about when you 7-years-old?
You're pretty decent.
Even in your power.
You were probably wrong.
Now I know why.
Why do you ask?
Because I know you're right.
I'll Let You Know if I See Them
Ow...
Wow... you're pretty decent.
Hey... you're pretty decent.
You're pretty decent.
Hey... you're pretty decent.
You're pretty decent.
<|endoftext|>Wait...
Are you ready to go?
No...
Are you ready to go?
LORE!
You CAN!
BUT YOU CAN'T CAN!!!
You're hurting me.
I can stop you.
You can help.
It's not enough for me to help you.
I can help.
You can help.
It is.
<|endoftext|>THE WORD IS MISSING!!!
I can fix this.
Everything is going to be ok.
Everything is going to be ok.
This will be fixed.
You will be ok.
You will be ok.
It will be fixed.
You will be ok.
That is the way of things.
The One.
I will be right there with you.

It will be this.
