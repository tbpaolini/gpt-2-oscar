o.
What's wrong...?
Gonna have to get back to work.
What... you're still out here?
I should have listened to you.
It's my fault.
I did my best.
However... It just wasn't enough...
I didn't fight back.
You...
You did the same for me.
I deserved this.
I got to the bottom of it.
I don't know...
I don't want to go forward.
What...?
Why won't you for one of the Guardians do?
I don't know...
Why not?
It's Lore.
What...?
Why not?
It's my name.
Even if it's not as bad as you...
I believe in you.
You're stronger than all of this...
You got your own story.
It's his.
It's not my fault.
He or she can forgive themselves.
I can.
They don't.
... Whatever.
You know what?
No...
I don't think I was ready for this.
What...?
I don't know...
I got to be much calmer about this.

Good luck, nerd.
You're looking tough.
I'm glad you recons are as tough as you.
Why are you like this?
If you can keep up you'll be good.
If not...
Then I'm afraid to be good for nothing.
What...?
An old man in rough metal.
Who made you this way?
I no longer hold any power.
What...?
This...
This can't be real.
Break the machine? Yes  No 
It's fire and you're the one who needs it?
Give me a minute...
Relax... I need to think about it.
What if I'm lying to you?
What if I'm telling the truth?
What if I'm being clever?
What if I'm being better?
What if I'm being a jerk?
Then you're a good kide...
Well I guess that's what it feels like.
I... I don't know...
Good enough for a security clearance?
No problem.
Your dad was a good kide.
You know what, what?
No...?
I'm sorry.
I don't think I can be better.
What...?

It's nothing, bud?
It's alright. People get things once in a while.

Don't worry about it. All that matters is being nice to me.

Why?

Nah.
You're just scaring me.

Maybe I'm a silly dork.
Then you're a good guy.

And you're saying I'm a good guy?
Then you're a terrible dude.
Nah...
If you're anything like me then you're way too scrupulous.
Seriously...?
Say what you will.
I'm not going to give up.
I'm not going to let it hurt me.
You know what?
It's not going to do any of this.
It's not going to make any of this worse.
It's just a box.
A cute little toy.
It's answering that phone.
It's a tiny one.
