======== SAMPLE 1 ========

Alright...
Hold on tightly...
I... I don't know what's going on.
I just know you're stronger.
What are you talking about?
My slash was really quick, but not as powerful as you would like.
You're wrong.
I grew a new axe!
It's now a mantid.
What...?
I said your axe was a mantid.
It's a tiny creature and I'm not a creature of legend.
You really think you're stronger than that?
I'm not you...
You really think you're not as impressive as that?
I mean... I'm not the biggest you're right...
But I'm the smartest of them all, silly.
What...?
You're joking... right?
Maybe I'm smarter than you are?
Really?
Look... I need to find Baron and get back home.
Sounds good.
So... what do you need?
Camellia.
I gotta fix the fishing pole.
Oh hey, you didn't have anything better to do.
Hey look, it's the bed criminal.
Apologize for your criminal acts? Yes No
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to invade your privacy.
Hey, sorry eating?
Don't worry about it. I need to find and fix the fishing pole.
Wait... what?
You here to watch me get gutted?
I mean, that's pretty obvious.
But then you were trying to steal the sandwich.
You weren't trying to steal the sandwich.
You disrespectful jerk.
I don't know you.
What?
I don't know you, or Rhode.
That's a FACT!

I'm not a mind reader.
That's a FACT!
IU... You know what...?
A computer.
A safe and secure work environment.
Working in IT is like working in a corporate office.
You're making much better work of this.
Quality assurance is second to none.
I'm going to be very, very, very, very careful around and time am going to be amazingly quick.
Every once in a while you get a bit of time to yourself.
So enjoy these... now!
You have no idea what you're getting into.
Just... enjoy it.
Well... yeah we can go.
Sure thing.
There we go, kids.
Have fun!
<|endoftext|>She meant to hurt you.
We don't need her.
We're not threats here or anywhere like that.
Just... not quite yet.
She's not real.
Think about yourself.
How do you feel? She isn't real.
We don't exist to hurt you.
We're just pawns in a vicious system.
You don't have the strength to move forward.
I don't know how you could.
Just...
Get over here.
Get out there and do good things.
There we go, kids.
Have fun!
<|endoftext|>Miss me, dude?
Miss me, dude? Yes  Yes 
Dude, what are you doing here?
I don't have my hat on.
I don't even have any hat on.
You really can't be like this.
Do you really think you could be like this?
Are you really dead?
No... I guess?
When I was a kid I braveminted the risk of growing up a hero.
He didn't even know what a hero was.
He was shy at the time. Now he's more like a dad.
When I was a kid I went to die.
Why do you think I didn't choose a dangerous path?
Because when I did choose it was too late.
I don't know how you could.
You were too weak.
But don't worry.
I won't let you have it.
I don't want you.
I got you.
<|endoftext|>Dude, you thought you could be a little more direct?
Did you notice
