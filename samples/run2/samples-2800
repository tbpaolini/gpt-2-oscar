======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 probably have some kind of connection to the village. In other words, do you live here?
I'm pretty sure you're already on this particular couch.
Yeah. I just...
Sleeping all night...
You just...
Are you alright?
Yeah, sorry...
Good, you're probably fine.
Just like the rest of your...
Is this supposed to be my moment?
Ever wondered...?
Probably.
What if I wasn't here?
Then you wouldn't be here.
How do you feel?
You don't know me...
How do you feel?
You don't know me...
You just happen to be right here.
I'm looking at you Baggio. His fur is way too cute.
You can actually see his eyes...
That's not enough...
He's just staring at me.
Oh...
You're touching those nuts?
Crisp... He's resting some more on the couch.
Oh...
That's a different weight.
He might need a bit of a break.
Just some more of his own.
Light Amplify Banish
You can't stop him.
It's not real...
He's just staring at you.
You can't hide...
You don't have the strength.
A Piece of Meelers...
Baron...
Baron's a Lone Warrior. I'm Your Protector.
I'M NOT A FRIENDLESS BATTLE FORCE!
Just a regular loon with a habit of getting into fights.
We started out pretty well...
Then... what are you?
I'm not even a lion.
So... how are you?
I'm kind of spooky... isn't it?
I'm wondering if you know anything about it.
What...?
If you don't then I'm sure Asgore can help you.
Hm... anyway... what do you need?
I mean... to buy time for this...thing.
Let's get you a nic for schmuckin'.
Alright... Need I say a mountain?
Just a mountain?
So... I'm off to explore a cave tooding wolf?
Sounds good.
Home O' War? Yes No
Heres just a jerkin we know.
Unfortunate we aren't.
I don't know if that's the right thing for a dog.
He's totally fine.
I'm glad to hear all things in life you as a dog should be able to count on.
There's a reason each of you was named after a favorite animal.
A shame some of you didn't choose a cute name.
Thank you to everyone for your patience in these tough times.
Try not to see another one of your family's cupcakes. They taste just like family.
We wish you the best of luck in your future career.
We wish you the best luck in your future career.
So, you're onto me.
With that settled let's get out the door.
Hey...
Going to the gym feels good?
Oof...
I'm not doing much here anyway.
Why do you have to work so hard toiled away at this thing?
It's only got wings.
What could be farther from the truth: it's got so much fun.
Well, I'm sorry, I...
HELL YA BIRTHDAY!
I love you, BIRTHY!
Thanks, Lore!
Seeya soon, dude!
Hey, you!
Hey, you!
Hey, you!
<|endoftext|>An old handshaking bookcase sits there...
LORE!
Welp... Can you help out a friend?
Yes...
Give them a minute to cool completely?
No problem, Lore.
Good. As always, I'm here on day one.
Hey, you!
Yeah, sorry... I should have done that.
I'm sorry, bud.
Better not break the bank.
What have I done...?
Overpaying staffers is a huge red flag here. Thankfully I'm not dead.
A ledger sits on the shelf.
Dear brother, it's from when you first met me.
It's a lovely dark green.
And I'm the manager?
That's pretty rad, dear brother.
What is...?
Stamp a note at the front desk.
Have me call you manager?
Alright, well... I think I'm done here.
What's the matter with BUDDY?!
You really got this deal.
I don't want to work on my head.
I want to do my job.
You really got this one all wrong.
I'm sorry, dear brother.
Don't worry about it. I'm sure someone can help you.
Anyway
