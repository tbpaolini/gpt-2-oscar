 still to keep others out.
It may say something different though.
Don't know what that thing is, anyway.
Looks like 4C is open! Right next to that weird shirt guy.
Go play with your food!
You may go but don't give up.
This is old men. Memory foam will not fire twice.
That's some kind of locust?
No.
Orchid?
I will let you choose!
Oh yes. Go pick them up!
I wonder what you would do if given the choice?
What?
Maybe go with Fern?
Maybe not.
Well... choice.
It's a pretty old oak handbag.
Cumberland and Cacti are growing in the dirt.
A bunch of flower seeds mashed up with the new umbrella materials.
There's a terracotta letter in here. It says 'WHERE IS THE GREAT WAR?!?!?
Gotta lighten up ya grave!
<|endoftext|>It's full of... tax papers? Gross...
A bunch of tax papers? Gross... You know... I'm not a taxidermist.
I get it though. Time is money.
Go talk to Gilly. Work is done!
Haha, that's a lot of paper... How expected.
Wow... That was pretty rough... I'll have to try next time...
Hey Gilly, was that... or is it...
Have you tried eating flowers? Like most things in life. Plants wouldn't let me eat flowers.
I like flowers. They're so life-changing.
I'm glad you doubt me. I'm good friends with Oviedo. Be careful!
I never did.
I'm so sorry... I didn't mean to.
It's alright. People make mistakes.
Don't worry about it. You got your ducks. We got things done.
I'm glad you understand.
I'm sorry... We don't had a choice.
Yeah well, you don't have many choices.
I'm glad you understand.
I'm sorry... We didn't have a choice.
Yeah well, you don't have many choices.
You're kind of scaring me... Is everything ok?
It's going to be ok. I believe in you.
Ughh... what was that?
You got hit in the head with a fishing pole.
Who threw a fishing pole?
Clearly nobody here.
Anyway... CATCH IT! CATCH THE THING!
Man, you're like, really bad at this.
Eugh....
I don't know what you expected.
Maybe I expected you to be less sarcastic.
Then you expected wrong.
Did you seriously just miss?
Nope.
So you were trying to get those bones?
Definitely.
You weren't trying to catch the fly?
Nope.
Gross dude.
You're gross, dude.
Nah.
Wow... that was kinda grim.
I mean... it's not the worst thing I've seen here.
What's the worst thing...?
Don't worry about it.
At least it was quick...
It's not always quick...
What...?
Don't worry about it...
Hey... you alright?
Yeah sorry... just thinking about something.
Your friend Baron...
Blurgghhhh...
AAAAAAY!!!
You ok?
Yeah ok!
I mean... I don't know how...
Well I'm glad.
You're kind of scaring me... Is everything ok?
It's going to be alright. I believe in you.
Yeah but...
You're kind of scaring me...
Oh... sorry... I'll get out of your way...
Don't worry about it.
You sure?
Yeah sure...
I'm glad you got along alright?
That's all it took?
Ask for it, ask for it.
It wasn't like that...
Yeah... maybe a little...
ER... what are you?
Nobody said that...
Well... maybe a little.
You're kind of scaring me... Is everything ok?
Yeah... I don't know...
I'm kind of used to weird outbursts at this point.
Yeah but I'm not a weird outburstsmith.
A little weird for a weirded-out animal.
None at all animalistic in their ilk.
I mean... nothing?
Don't worry about it.
What are you talking about?
Playing games.
Pinging menial scraps of wood with stones?
RUN YOU FOOL!!!
You know what?
I'M FINE!!!
And now?
WEAK!!!
And now? WEAK!!!
And now?
NOTHING!!!
