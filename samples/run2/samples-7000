======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 1 you don't?
NO!!! STOP!!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS!!!
Was that really so hard...?
Pained? Pulled? Can you feel it?
It's yours.
No.
You can't.
It's yours.
Na...
Oh... Sorry.
Don't worry about it.
I did what you did. I'm not a monster.
It's your fault.
I did what you did. I'm not a monster.
You really can't hurt me...
I'm not that scary a monster.
I got arm and a head and I'm good.
That's it.
Get over here already.
I'm not going to lie.
You were trying to scare me.
You almost made it.
I'm not going to lie...
I was trying to stay out of your way.
Why are you here...?
Why do you keep going so fast?
Why do you keep going like that...?
I did what?
3... 4...
What are you talking about?
Is this what it feels like?
Is this what it feels like...?
You're being a bit of a s---.
I'm not making this any more of a personal choice.
I can't and won't let you.
I don't have the strength to stop you.
I don't have the strength to stop you...
That's not very nice...
Oh... Uhhh... Sorry?
Don't worry about it.
I mean... This is what I wanted.
This is what she wanted.
You're wrong.
I'm right here.
Heh...
Put him away.
What are you doing?
I don't need your pity.
Why are you hesitating?
Why is that...?
When I asked you for advice you lied to me.
You lied to me. You lied to the world.
You knew that but you didn't act.
You concealed it.
You didn't hide it.
I... I don't know how...
You're starting to understand.
They are my...
What...?
When we went to lunch you didn't help at all.
You just sat there dodging flowers.
Then you told me to give you advice.
It's your fault.
That's it.
Don't worry about it.
We can go on...
Ask for advice from someone else.
Are you ready for it?
It won't matter.
You can't fight anyone like you are now.
They will remember you even if you don't survive.
Even if you don't love them as much as you love me.
Even if you are right...
I can't fix this...
Just keep going...
You can't hurt anyone like you.
I'm not even mad...
I did my best...
Nothing...
You can't hurt anyone like you.
I'm glad you turned down the favor.
It was just a fight...
You know...
You didn't want to give up on him.
He was a monster for saying that.
I'm glad you turned down the favor.
It didn't have to be that way.
Just...
You know how it is.
I wasn't trying to hurt you.
I was just trying to familiarize myself with the challenge.
It's your fault.
That's it...
What are you waiting for?.
This is what I wanted.
The other day I was like you didn't want anything to do...
You're right. Unfortunately you did wrong.
I'm sorry...
Just do your best.
I'm trying to be better but you're not being better.
You're right...
That's it...
Don't worry about it.
We can get back on track together.
Ugh...
I'm out of here...
How do I leave?
I... what...?
Stay?
I don't know what to say...
Why not?
Why not?
Why not?
Don't give up.
You've defeated the odds and am back on track.
I'm off to enjoy my life instead.
So... you're back out in the woods?
Nope!
What did you just say to me?
Obedient...
Were you listening to me?
No...
What do you mean?
What does it matter where you are?
What do you mean?
You're right.
It does.
What do you mean?
You left it there.
Huh... I never thought about it that way.
Yeah... I guess?
So like everything in life you learn when you follow your heart?
Not really... I mean... I guess?
You know... You're right.
Yeah... You do?
