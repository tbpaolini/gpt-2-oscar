Wait... what?
There you go. That's pretty cool, don't worry about it.
Thanks, Whistler.
Can't talk right now. Just wanna get some sleep.
You dropped some garbage.
Hey, did you just drop a flower?
Yeah! Like... AGAIN!
Well, Fern did say I'm bad at following directions. Let's take a look.
So...? Fern's back on the path!
Wait... what?
Lore you back?
More work for my new friend.
He's an old friend.
You really think so?
It's true...
I... I'll let you down...
It's true!
What are you talking about?
Going back to bed.... or is it really that hard?
No... it's not THAT hard.
... I don't know if I agree with you...
Might enjoy... being you.
Don't worry about it. Let's go grass!
Hey... you alright?
Yeah sorry... Just kinda phased out for a minute there.
Sure you alright?
Yeah sorry. Good luck out there.
Hey Lore.
Thanks...
You're the boss.
Yeah boss.
Alright you wanna go?
Yep!
This is gonna be fun!
Sounds good.
Do you want to go or not?
You can go either way.
I'm not even sure if going or not is right.
The Artifact is just like any other home.
You'll see in time.
I'll let you know if I have any... food.
That's it?
That's it.
Okay... I gotta get back to the pool.
What if I don't want to?
What if I don't want to?
You'll see in time.
I'll let you know if I have any... or not.
That's it.
That's it.
You'll see in time.
I'll let you know if I have any... or not.
Oh no...
Don't worry about it.
I mean... I think she's pretty.
Can you be more specific?
Yeah... I think so.
LEAVE MY BOY HURT ME OUT OF MADMINES !!!
That's not what I sa...
GREAT!
He's finished.
She's almost certain.
He left the same place I left him.
This is his chance.
Don't give up.
I'm proud of you.
You're almost there. Keep going.
I believe in you.
You're ready now.
You got this.
You got this.
<|endoftext|>Here to watch me get RIPPED? Nah Yea
Tch, thought so... nerd.
Anyway, someone left some junk on the bench. I threw it down below if you want it.
Don't get in my way, nerd. PUMPIN' IRON is dangerous work.
Thanks, nerd. For nothing, nerd.
No problem, nerd.
boards.cards.ykc - Collection of Collar...
All of them... What a wonder.
All of them... What a mystery.
All of them... What a gazoo.
What a gag.
Arial is about to open the chest.
Hey, that's better.
It's not my fault.
You... That's a FACT!
It's not real.
... Fact!
The trick is in the judge!
Wait... really?
Yeah... I guess I's done.
Oh... Sorry for the trouble.
Good, I understand.
So, would you like to go?
Maybe some other day then...
Something about the way you look this...
seems pretty... familiar.
That's not... happening.
Could it be... getting ready for a fishing expedition?
What kind of place is this?
You're in my fishy home. Let me know if you need anything.
Wait... I already have everything I need.
What?
You're looking at serious property damage liability. You're breaking the law. Don't be silly.
I'll try not to be silly.
Think nothing of the cute things I brought you.
So... you're not a casualty of not paying your water bill.
Well, you aren't a casualty of not paying your water bill.
I'm just saying...You're more of a jerk than I would've like...
Seriously?
Yeah... I guess?
But there you have it. Good on you.
Hey, you think I could ask you something pretty serious?
I guess?
So, you know Fern... right?
Yes?
What do you think about her?
What do you think about Fern? She seems pretty ok
