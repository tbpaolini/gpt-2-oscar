Shelves of 'finance records' written in strange symbols.

Goodbye, Hot Chip.
<|endoftext|>The wind plays through the trees as leaves fall around you.
Record the journey so far? No Yes
The ink sinks into the page and fades out. Your progress has been saved.
The air is cold and clings to your skin. This place can't be real. Maybe if you wake up it will go away.
Try to wake up? No Yes
<|endoftext|>Finally paying attention are we?
Took you long enough...
Just a few mistakes here and there.
Nobody will notice... right?
Leaving just one flower...
You're pretty messed up. You know that right?
You just can't help yourself...
What an animal.
Cat got your tongue?
I... don't know what to say.
Well, that didn't stop you before.
What do you mean?
You really wanted to dig... didn't ya?
You barely knew her.
What are you talking about?
Rhode, ya dingus.
You never talked to her.
Yet you still tried to give me advice.
Well... yeah I guess.
Why?
Why did you give Fern advice? I wanted to help. I wanted to know more.
Wait... really?
Yeah...
I wasn't trying to be a jerk. Sorry if it came across that way.
Huh... that kinda changes things.
Seriously...?
Yeah...
You do realize how messed up that is right?
I mean... maybe?
You're wrong.
What...?
I talked to her before we went to lunch.
She clearly likes you.
Liked...
What...?
Where do you think we are?
What do you think this place is?
She LIKED me...
And now she's gone...
We both are...
This is your fault. You wanted to hurt her.
