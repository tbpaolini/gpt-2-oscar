Hey Pat?
Yeah you do?
Let's go nerd!
Nice! So... are you ready to proceed?
Yep...
Good. Alright, to the north?

A few loose ends...

Cafes are provided for those that give away free stuff. Giveaways are run through a bar on the right.
Why would I give away bars...? Giveaways are usually good when FRIENDS are lacking.
Well... I guess that helps explain why you only found a few trapped in this cage.
Quickly jump over the edge and start the next one.
The timer will begin on the 5th of each month.
Have an intense fast and don't give up.
Ahh... I'm ready.
Nice.

Wrong path, guy.

A few cups of slow, steady sweat has the desired effect.

The screen is tearing itself out.
Oh... Sorry... I wouldn't mind
Delicious!

Hello again, little one.
It's your fault for toiling in this magical cavern...it's yours.
Well... I guess?
You are an animal... This isn't right.
