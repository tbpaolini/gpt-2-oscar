 dead.
That's enough.
Time to clean house.
Hurt them.
Make them pay.
Hurt them.
No...
You didn't.
It's not my fault.
It just so happens.
I...
Put the shoe down. I'm done with work.
I just need to know what's going on.
Huh... that's good you know.
Does it matter?
Not much... I can do this.
 Let's go, Newhire.
UCK Hey!
Hey!
Crushed dinosaur! Welcome to The Towerist! I always wanted to be a dinosaur!
Seriously...?
You're hurting me...
Your love...
You can't forgive me.
No...
I'll admit... I really wanted to hurt you.
Just... don't do it again.
I got this.
Don't worry about it.
I got this.
What did you expect?
You get my O every day.
I don't get to decide what people deserve or not.
I get this.
You're right.
I'm sorry. Don't worry about it.
I'm sorry?
Yes?
I don't even get to decide what people deserve or not.
I get this.
All of this and I still don't get a single one of you to blame.
I don't even get to stop you to meany.
I can fix this...
All I do is blame yourself.
All of this and I still don't get a single one of you to blame.
Yes...
You're right.
But I feel bad about what's happening.
It needs your help...
It deserves to be heard...
It doesn't let you detract from its message.
At least...
It doesn't feel about... me.
<|endoftext|>Wait... really?
 REALLY??
You're right. The truth will help him.
He can't hurt you...
You're also right. But only if you follow my lead.
I don't have much of a choice.
What do you mean?
We can talk later. Thanks, Lore.
LORE?
How do you know? You talked to Cho.
Yes?
We had a good time discussing it.
Fine... I guess?
Fine I guess?
Good.
We should get going. We both are.
I gotta get rid of this stick before you go.
Why not?
Think about Rhode. Think about how you felt when you didn't give him the hint.
Anya lay motionless in the sand.
She's completely devoid of emotion.
All you did was tell her to stay home.
I... I don't know...
She did nothing.
Disgusting.
What could have possibly gone wrong?
You pretty much told her to go.
I'm thankful for everything you did.
I understand why you chose to stay home.
But you weren't enough.
You were so strong.
It's not that I didn't care about you.
I just don't know what you had in common.
You know...
You're stronger.
You know exactly what lay ahead.
You chose to take that chance.
You're more than capable of it.
I've worked really, really, really, really, really, really... wrong decisions.
I let go of them.
I didn't give him the hint.
He's here. He's killing you.
It's your fault.
You're right. I'm outside thinking about you and you've gotta go.
You're right. I'm outside... wrong.
You know what?
You're wrong.
I'm stronger.
I told you what...
You're right. I've still got your back.
You know what?
It's not enough to just go. You have to give.
That $123 you're looking at is super useful right?
Yeah... I would have paid for that sooner.
But I don't really know what you need.
What?
I got this.
This is your problem.
If you can take it and go then I'll be okay.
If not then what other solutions do you have?
Nothing I can think of.
A few thoughts about...
Me: How do you know?
How do you know? Joe: You told me!
I'm pretty sure you both.
Yeah... maybe you were right...
You're pretty sure?
Yeah.
You were right...
Yeah.
You should probably get going. I got stuff to do.
What...?
What did you just say to me?
It's your fault.
You're right. I'm a bad guy.
Yeah... maybe you were right...
You should to
