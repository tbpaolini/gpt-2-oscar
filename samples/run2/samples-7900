RHODE!
Yeah?
Everything is fine ya big dork.
Oh... Sorry... I'll get out of your way...
Don't mind her... She means well.
I'm kind of used to weird outbursts at this point.
Neat I guess? Anyway... what did you need?
Emelio said to come find Fern to help me fix this pocketwatch.
Hey that's me!
You're Fern?
No. Clearly, I'm Emelio.
Oh don't look at me like that. I'm just ribbin' ya.
......
Alright alright... Lemme see this thing.
Ramul gave me this pocketwatch and I need some help fixing it.
Lemme take a look.
Wow.
Wow?
Yeah, wow.
....
This thing is proper thrashed.
Well yeah. That's why I'm here.
Yeah but, this is super messed up. Like totally messed up.
This is getting silly. Keep your cool. No, this is obnoxious.
Do you think you can fix it?
Can you fix it or not?
I mean, yeah totally.
.......
What?
Will you please fix the watch.
Oh yeah! For sure. We gotta get lunch first though.
Lunch?
Well yeah, don't want to work on an empty stomach. Come on inside.
Lunch with a deer and a mountain lion. Sounds good.
Alright so we're off to the deep woods.
Aren't we already in the woods?
Well... yeah. But not the deep woods.
Why do you keep saying deep woods like that...?
Come on! It's time to get some munchies.
This is gonna be fun!
So... where are we going?
To the woods.
What...?
You'll see, silly.
What if I don't go?
Then you'll be missing out on a new experience.
Never thought about it that way.
Don't worry about it. Let's get going.
Heres that watch of yours! Thanks for everything. -Fern
Reading that again feels like... work.
Ey buddy, watchit! We're workin 'ere!
What are you working on?
Picketing!
Picketing what?
The game developer for making us block your path!
Yeah that's fair.
Better not break the picket line.
A ledger sits on a cool smooth stone.
Record the journey so far? No Yes
The ink sinks into the page and fades out. Your progress has been saved.
At least this place seems comfortable.
Rest in the soft grass? No Yes
<|endoftext|>YOU GREAT FOOL!!!
HOW COULD YOU RAISE ARMS AGAINST AN INNOCENT?!
Uh... Emelio...?
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?!
EMELIO!!!
WHAT?!
I... Uh...
Disappointed Armadilloises
I can just go. You seem a bit... occupied.
I'm not going to let you hurt me again.
Wait... Please tell me what you require.
Are you sure?
Yes... I have failed you twice already.
Alright... Ramul told me to stop by and ask you about fixing this watch.
A noble quest...
WE WILL LEAVE AT ONCE!!!
Wait... we?
With you as my squire we will conquer this challenge.
Uh... squire?
QUICKLY NOW!!!
How do I keep getting into these situations...
A strange offering to untold entities.
A shrine to Misery and Mania.
A petty offering to false gods.
Simple tools worn from years of use.
A masters tools, worn with years of use.
Ancient and dusty tools. Why would anyone use these?
A strange assortment of minerals and crystals.
Fantastic treasures from untold adventures beneath the earth.
Dust collectors litter the table.
Crystalline structures fill the two stones.
These would look really pretty with the right light on them.
A few colored stones sit on the shelf.
A bunch of small parts waiting for Emelio to use them.
Tiny pieces waiting to be part of something greater.
Bits of trash leftover from projects.
Half-finished projects and tools are scattered around.
It looks like Emelio's tinkering around with new ideas.
None of these things are even close to finished.
It seems to have lost its light.
A unused lamp waiting for a firefly.
Long since burnt out.
It's a big slab of bedrock.
It's
