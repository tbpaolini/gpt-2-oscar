, the price for that mistake...?
It's very rare that I see you again.
If you're...
Any chance goes?
Zero.
We will see, dear brother.
We will, dear sister.
Not much longer, little one.
It is too late for it to die, dear sister.
Forget this place.
This place doesn't matter, dear brother.
It can't help himself.
He is in for a rude awakening.
<|endoftext|>There's a large stone pick up.
A little bowl of urchin food. It tastes like... mud?
Not sure how you could say...
This thing is big for a stone.
A small bowl of iced tea. It seems harmless.
A little bowl of iced jus... It tasted like it was injured?
A small bowl of iced manus... It tasted like it was thankful for what little?
Hey, you're in my personal space though...
Seriously?
NO!
This isn't real...
You and I are different animals.
What if I'm wrong?
Probably by chance, dear brother.
Wait... what?
You're right! I am bisexual and your opinion is my alone?!
What if I'm right?
You'd better get out of my way.
Just leave me alone already?
No way.
You're-
You're not welcome.
Get out of my way.
You're not welcome.
No.
you're not welcome.
No.
<|endoftext|>It's... too cute.
Easier said for a unicorn than doours.
Aged hoofers are out to take a nap? You'd be hard pressed to find a better sleep than one made out.
Newer hoofers are starting to look as though they've been stolen from them.
A pair of blood red water bladders sit here looking pretty.
A small pocket watch is stuck to the side.
There's a brightly colored flower at the bottom of the pot.
<|endoftext|>Can't Hear You, Can Weeee?
Maybe. I'm not that good a listener.
I'm about as bad as someone says I'm a thing.
On the other side of town... I live.
Or is that a Stroke Away?
Not if you want to get out of town.
Or if you want to live.
Or if you want to live.
Or if you want to steal a bushel of sand from a coffee shop?
Or anything in between.
Oh yeah... and do you want to go yet?
Goaled? Yes. Hurry.
Sorry...
Don't worry about it.
This isn't my first time living... er... thing.
So... what now?
Filled out online studies.
What?
Found a smooth surface with a smooth surface.
Really?
That's pretty neat, huh?
I didn't mean to ask.
Better not break the law just yet.
Wh-what's the law?
I'll let you know if I get one.
What about after sex?
Fixed Answer: No
So what happened to the coffee?
Filled the cup down. 'Ting.'
<|endoftext|>Hey look, you can't stop me.
I don't know what you thought of my approach.
Maybe you're right...
You shouldn't call me Cub.
Maybe.
Full of hate and doubt.
You're only as dumb as your thought patterns are.
What could go wrong?
It wasn't my place to do this.
I did what I felt was right.
That's not what happened.
You're right.
I'm sorry, bud.
I'm sorry too.
Don't worry about it.
We can look at you from the sidelines.
Did you just say I shouldn't be studying politics?
That's pretty ridiculous isn't it?
Dear my word...
You're wrong.
I... I shouldn't be studying politics.
Hey, stop that.
What did you just say?
You asked me.
I was leveling up a friend for you.
Well yeah. But I wasn't leveling up for you.
<|endoftext|>Hey look, you guy.
Yeah... You totally got it.
What...?
Just met you.
I'm Lore.
Hey! Can you be again?
Yep! I mean... Guylike.
Nice. How are you?
Huh...?
Just got my green eye shadow on you.
Yeah... Confirmed?
Yeah. Done?
Wow... Look at how pretty that is.
I guess I is?
Yeah dude?
What's that smell like?
