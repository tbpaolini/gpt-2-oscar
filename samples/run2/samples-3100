I'm alright. I'm with you.
That's it.
Get back to yourself. That's pretty obnoxious.
I don't know what you expected.
You really need to let it go.
You're kind of scaring me... Is everything ok?
I mean... I don't know...
That's good advice.
Don't give up.
You've got a lot on your plate...
You can handle it.
You're a good person.
You've got a lot on your plate.
I'm glad you see things your way.
I'm glad you see things your way.
You've got a lot on your plate...
You know what...? It's not my fault.
Yeah well... you're just wasting time.
Do you really think you can help someone as simple as me?
I hope so...
You understand that better than that.
You're a scum monkey.
What...?
You killed him.
You murdered my brother.
You murdered his best friend.
You killed his best friend's dog.
All of this and you really just hurt him?
He's not worth the time.
I hope you understand when you do.
I'm sorry... I don't really understand yet.
One more thing...
I really should leave this alone.
It's not my fault.
I really am.
Well... let's get on with it then.
Nothing... not even a whim...
You really are a scum monkey.
Hurt me? I kill... about... anything.
Give me time? Like this... 1) Find him quickly 2) Find him back at home.
This is serious.
You're hesitating. Tell him to turn himself in.
Show him your... tax? Yes No
knew you were going to do this.
You were going to do this was how it worked.
I... I won't say anything.
No.
Alright... I'll let you know if I find anything.
Really?
Yeah... down at the office for a bit?
I don't think I can do this alone.
So you can you try?
Yeah... I mean... we should get going.
No... No...
becko...
Baron...
Baron...
It's not the time...
Its the problem.
It has...
You'll understand when it's over.
It is but a suggestion.
Time shall tell.
And what shall you tell me?
How shall you know?
What shall you wish for?
Will it last?
Thoughts or regrets?
You may know...
You don't.
But you will remember.
I did... I sallied...
Choosing...affects...me....
It didn't.
I... I wasn't there...
And what...?
What does it mean to be a monster?
It means you're weak.
Its means you've been weak.
You hurt him.
He hurt you too.
Even now.
You don't feel loved.
You defend him like you deserve.
Why do you need to know?
Because when it hurts...
It will be over soon.
I... I'm not wrong.
He was always going to be...
You're right. He was always going to be great.
There's a reason we call that strength.
You were always going to be better.
You're wrong.
You're always wrong.
I can help.
Yes...
No...
I can't right now.
It will happen and I will make it happen...
You're right.
You've always been wrong.
You stole the show.
You missed the mark.
I always had a fear of the dark.
Dark forces worked here and now.
You're right. The path from here to there.
Is.Noth.
I.KELOW.
FOR GREATNESS'T REAL !!!
