Don't worry...
I'll try HARDER.
Haha... now that...
That'snt very fun...
You almost made it!
Just... dont do it...
All of a sudden... you're smell like dill...
You usually do...
Nah...
Really?
Just give it time.
The next room has a hanging flower.
Materials... for a guy who's got an eye...
Instructions on how to reach for yourself.
Not enough room?
You're not ready.
Another door...
A different one...
It's gone...
Almost all dead ends now.
The leatherbound handbag... What a nerd!
The bag is too tight.
It's too fast...
You're getting sweaty.
It's still not dry.
Thanks...
It's just a bag...
A tiny bag...
A tiny bag...
Full of... dill?
You're getting a bit sweaty.
The ink sinks into the bag and fades out.
Couldn't put another one...
They said you had super cool feet.
That's just fine.
Desk? What kind of place?
You're in my blood.
I'm a Globetrotter.
Yeah, that's pretty awesome.
Might want to take a minute here before we go.
Seriously, what are you wearing?
Cuffed catsjuice in here.
That was just a friend...
tips and favaplers.
Little junk for me to throw away.
This thing looks pretty smarmy.
Cacti are growing in the sand.
These are just waiting for you.
The container is still in the bag.
You're not looking at the container.
The bag is in good condition with some worn and violated leathers.
The strap is still in good condition, but not as high as in years.
Oh boy, still no look on the side of the road.
Neat. Here's another one!
It's a bunch of tiny mudsprouts with little bugs in here.
Those are for Dramavian, my salamander.
That's kind of scaring me... Is he scaring himself as well?
These salamander parts look pretty scuffed.
There's a salamander bed to look at!
<|endoftext|>Hey Dramavian!
This is Player A's salamander! They look pretty smarmy.
That's kind of scaring me...
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Welcome to OScarWorld! Wanna know what's on the other side of the bar?
Well yeah, don't think I got my wish.
Welcome to OScarWorld! I mean... YouTubers should probably get out of here.
Hey you TObesey! You should check out their place.
Oh yeah, don't want to go in there.
Hey WaffleHead?
Yeah dude. I'm Publick ShortSquire.
Alright. Alright.
Also, don't go in there.
Also, don't want to go in there.
Oh yeah, don't want to.
Any time, gentleman.
uck You probably should.
Yeah well, maybe.
That's clearly not for the best in Jung uppers.
Wait, don't worry about it.
Yeah sure.
Let's get you a new one!
What?
You'll have to wait in line for work.
Well I mean... I was... wait a minute.
So I changed the subject.
Well yeah, I mean.
Don't worry about it.
Well maybe a bunch of rainy earth right?
Yeah... maybe.
A bunch of rainy earth.
What kind of stuff?
You know... dirt pots. You look silly.
Oh... just give me a minute.
Yeah sure.
Alright. Let's go.
Yeah sure. Is his food ismilo?
Everything ok?
Yeah... Just... stop trying to make me feel anything.
Fine...
What about coffee?
Is his food ismilo?
Yeah... He really doesn't have much in the way of mouth water.
So he's not a drinker?
Nope.
But... what about coffee?
Is his food ismilo?
You're ridiculous.
Alright... I'll try...
Alright...
Don't worry about it.
Oh yeah, I think I'll pass.
All mixed drinks out of the trash.
Man, I'm a coffee drinker.
You're just waiting for this weird contraption to magically appear out of thin and hard.
Let me know if you need help getting across the finish line.
Might as well let you know.
At least it is safe here
