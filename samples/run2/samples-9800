It has to be this way...
It's really not my fault.
What if I'm wrong?
What if I'm right?
What if I's wrong?
You're wrong.
You're always wrong.
What...?
I just don't see the point.
Oh fine... let's get going then. Your ignorance is mostly gone.
Nice, clearly.
Thanks.
I'm sorry... but my choice not.
OH! Sorry...?
Don't worry about it.
Thanks!
I... I won't let you say a word.
That's fine... I won't let you say a word.
It's fine... I don't think I should be talking about you.
What if I'm wrong?
What if I'm right?
You're wrong.
I win.
I don't need your pity.
�
Well... that did feel good.
I'm sorry...
Don't worry about it.
I won't let you say a word.
That's fine... I won't let you say a word.
It's fine... I don't think I need your pity.
�
Oh my...
I'm sorry...
Thank you for your...
No problem.
I'm sorry...
Thank you for your...
No problem.
Sorry...
Thank you for your...
No problem.
Like the lightswitch is supposed to be.
Looks like the power is still on. That's good at least.
Things are looking up for our brave adventurers.
Off to help a friend do his bit.
Sounds good.
Hey, thanks.
Keep going.
Everything is going to be ok.
You never thought about it...
You're going to make it...
Well, yeah... It's not like...
I... I don't know what you expected.
Maybe I expected you to be less sarcastic.
Then you expected wrong, brave man.
Did you seriously just miss?
Nope.
So you were trying to get those bones?
Definitely.
You weren't trying to catch the fly?
Nope.
Gross dude.
You're gross, dude.
Nah.
Wow... that was kinda grim.
I mean... it's not the worst thing I've seen here.
What's the worst thing...?
Don't worry about it.
At least it was quick...
It's not always quick...
What...?
Don't worry about it...
Hey... you alright?
Yeah sorry... just thinking about something.
Your friend Baron I take it?
How did you know...?
Don't worry about it.
Oh no...
GET THE THING
......
......
DO SOMETHING!!!
HYAAAAA!!!
Did you just throw a shoe?
Nah...
Who throws a shoe? Honestly...
Couldn't be me.
Wait...
Is that...
A stick?
BAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
That's not what I expected.
Well... mystery solved?
Yeah... I guess?
Let's head back to my place.
Gotta get to work on that watch of yours.
<|endoftext|>I know you're there.
SHOW YOURSELVES!!!
The vessel is stronger now.
Death lays in its wake.
More trees for the forest.
More kindling for the coming fire.
Life flourishes in its wake.
Less trees for the forest.
Less shelter for the coming storm.
It has yet to choose a path.
It will in time.
Time is running thin.
Then it will start again.
Born anew.
ANOTHER CYCLE
Who are you to judge anyway?
Shall we explain, dear sister?
Soon, dear brother.
How about now?
Are you prepared then?
It's time.
Break the mirror.
Hurt them? Yes Yes
Hurt them? You stopped yourself before. You can do it again.
Hurt them? Yes  Yes 
Determined to fail.
Yet unyielding in conviction.
A waste...
A different path.
It lacks conviction.
Unfortunate...
The influence is below it.
It sees the path ahead.
It may... in time.
A different path.
It's become tempermental.
Chaotic and malformed...
Yet the vessel nears completion.
Will this one break the cycle?
We will see, dear sister.
Of course, dear brother.
Not much longer, little one.
Not much longer.
<|endoftext|>It's a bunch of brightly colored ants. They look rather industrious.
Definitely more industrious than Tower Corp ants.
There's a small blue salamander
