======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 of me.
What are you talking about?
Rhode, ya dingus.
You never talked to her.
Yet you still tried to give me advice.
Well... yeah I guess.
Why?
Why did you give Fern advice? I wanted to help. I wanted to know more.
Wait... really?
Yeah.
I... I mean you just kind of passed out.
I'm sorry Fern...
That wasn't really my problem.
Do you really need help?
Nope.
So what happened?
Someone ran into you and knocked you out.
Someone...?
Someone.
And then someone brought me in here?
Yep.
Why...?
Definitely not to feed you to my snake or whatever.
That's kind of ridiculous.
Oh yeah... Sorry.
We can definitely work with that.
Great.
Alright you three, we can go.
Sure thing.
I'm open for it.
Alright, alright...
No need to get dressed.
You almost made it!
Sorry...
I just need to...
Whole bunchs...
Hands missing.
Going to try again?
No way...
This broken promise.
It was made with love and farts.

I'll be honest though...
Don't worry about it.
Yeah what did you just say?
I guess?
Let's head back to my place.
Uhh... I get it though.
Sounds good.
Yeah... maybe I'm a little too good at it.
That's the way of things.
Abandoning husband and wife for good.
What...?
You fell on me...
You should have avoided the trap at the last second.
OH NO!!!
I forgive you...
It's just a phone... You know that instinct.
It should work the first try.
I just...
It's my problem.
Problem?
Oh boy... It's real ya.
I guess so... Don't worry about it.
Oh boy... Another part...
Another part BODY WEAK!!!
We don't need this more!
Da problem...
That's not what...
It's not real...
He's just playing with you.
I...
Something wrong...
Gimme a bit of...
Oh yeah...?
Ya didn't say anything.
I was just thinking about something else.
So... what is it?
Looks like he's using your memory.
Yeah... sure.
That's good advice.
I'm not sure if that's the right idea or if it's all mixed up.
I'm just saying it's easier to forget when you're not focusing on anything than to remember when you're standing a little better.
That's pretty messed up.
You're right. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too...
It's water under the bridge.
Uhh... that's pretty messed up.
You're right. I'm sorry.
Uhh...
Uhh...
Oh my...
Uhh my...
Uhh my...
Oh no...
Don't worry about it.
Well yeah. You're a bad person if you think I'm a good person.
Well... you're right.
I'm sorry.
Uhh my...?
Oh yeah...
Do you want to talk about it?
Sure...
Let's head back to my place.
Sounds good.
Alright...
We can both at the bottom of this.
Sounds good.
Well... we can at the bottom of this.
Well... we're off to the deep woods.
Sounds good.
The earth is still damp.
That's about all I know.
Thanks...
Yeah, I guess so.
I guess... what do you want?
My name is Terry. I'm the head of the forest product.
That's pretty awesome.
That's pretty awesome.
Thank you?
Definitely a lot of junk.
Just a random thought...
Would you look at this.
Abandoning your best friend Joe at the drop of a hat.
Uh... isn't that music groovy?
Nah.
Nice.
You don't have any music playing.
Hrm... Alright.
Alright.
Someone put a dampener on here.
Looks like it's not working.
You didn't break any stringency rules.
This thing is not supposed to work.
Pool Pal Paul will show.
Yeah, that's fair.
Yeah, that's probably all we use here.
