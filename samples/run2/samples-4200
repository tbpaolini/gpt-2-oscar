Alright, I agree.
Great. I'm off to explore on my own.
What should I planning on doing for this... meal wagon or not?
Lunch guidelines focusing more on the meat.
A staple of this place.
A simple yet effective distraction during my time away.
Simple distractions brought to you by my assistants.
I expect this to be a good choice for you.
Not the best food truck in the city, but hey, that's just my opinion.
It's full of... well, anything.

Oh... sorry for... crude jokes.
Are you alright?

An open book reveals...
A jar of dark brown painkiller.
This object is twisted in your grasp.
A tiny jar of strong size M painkiller.
This object is tightly wrapped around my hand.
What... is that...?
This object is extremely unstable. Without research underway it will in time of war be nothing more than a shrine to Trapper.
