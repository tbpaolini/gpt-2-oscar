It may not feel like a thing of the past though.
You knew the man... right?
Just... don't say that to me.
I don't know what you expected.
What...?
Hope you find what you're looking for.
There's an old red book in here. 'How to Clean Floors for Maroons'
<|endoftext|>Clean floor for maroons?
You may drill down into the floor but not up into it.
You know what I always wanted... to the bone. A bunch of loose cannons mixed with your opponent's cubes. That's pretty brutal.
It's full of maroon and browns.
You can't miss it.
You forgot what you found.
You dropped your haul a while back.
No need to get back either.
You was looking pretty beat up but that's just the way of things.
Cup left with unknown side effect.
The flavor of the coffee fills the bloodstream while the other drug makes the next one more powerful.

The flavor of the coffee fills the bloodstream while the other one doesn't make it.
It tastes like sawdust and sadness mixed in.
The coffee fades out and you finish with a glass.
Maybe someone will notice?
I hope so... Let's dig in.
Let's do our part...
 right by him...
He's not there...
Sleep smooth... I wouldn't want to risk it.
You alright?
Huh... I just dont have the strength...
Don't worry about it. Something important is going to happen here.
Hey, you alright?
Yeah... Sorry... Just... Don't do this.
Tell her what kind of person you are?
Tell her what kind of person she is?
Don't worry about it.
You sure?
I mean... I don't want to mess that up.
 bad analogy considering how I went out but...
I don't know what you expected.
You really noticed.
 Come back with that.
The leatherbound handbound book is in here.
Could it be out of place?
Maybe I should give it a try.
.
Hey Lore?
Yes, I must be back home.
Yeah well, I gotta get back to work.
This isn't real...
I don't know what I was thinking...
Go talk to your godfather.
Something about the way he treated you didn't look good.
I wish I could help you.
You're not coming back.
I don't know what I was thinking...
Try to steal the apple? No Yes
You didn't come looking for it.
Maybe I did...
You're wrong.
I don't remember the last time I saw him.
I wish I could help you.
You sure?
I remember when you first met him.
He's either here now or never.
I think I know what you are.
Look at you latter.
What's on your desk...
Something wrong?
Can't remember what...
Come check it out!
Lore...
How did you do that?!
Weren't you trying to steal the apple?
I meant to...
You did. You could have done it.
What are you talking about...?
Wall.
Who made you this way?
I don't know...
I just...
Put your trust in it.
It's broken now.
You're weak...
You're useless.
Leave him in my care. He was never your problem.
He's a memory - like you.
You're not there.
I don't know what you were thinking...
What are you thinking...?
Remember when you were like this?
I was like you.
You were like... nothing.
Remember when?
Remember...
You were like this.
You killed him.
You murdered his spirit.
All you wanted was love.
You murdered his father.
All you wanted was affection.
You murdered his brothers.
All you wanted was power.
You killed his father for being fatherless.
You murdered his brother for being fatherless.
All you wanted was power?
You killed his ghost.
That's not what happened.
The ghost was trying to steal the apple.
The apple was stolen.
I... I don't know what to say.
What do you mean?
What do you think someone stole the apple from you?
What do you think someone else stole the apple from you?
You know what? I don't.
