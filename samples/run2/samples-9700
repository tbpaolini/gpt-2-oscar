======== SAMPLE 1 ========
. Well duh! You've got a glowing stone now but you feel pretty uneasy.
Welp. I've lost it.
Talking animals... Floating heads... What next?
Don't forget about me.
Where are you going?
Are you alright?
Yeah... I just feel bad about the eggs.
You almost made it!
Just have to remember to breathe next time.
Yeah, that really wasn't easy...
You were doing awesome!
I felt like I was doing pretty alright for a minute there.
Just lost my balance running into things.
That's alright.
You did your best. That's what matters.
Hey, thanks.
Any time.
YOU CAUGHT THE FOOD BIRD!!! YOU'RE INCREDIBLE!!!
I did?!
YES!!!
Uh... where is it then?
I have no idea.
Seriously?
You passed out shortly after...
IT WAS AMAZING!!! YOU WERE AMAZING!!!
Well... thanks.
We don't have anything for lunch now though.
True...
Doesn't mean we didn't have fun.
True.
So... what now?
Well, it's a nice day... Wanna hang out for a bit?
You're wasting time.
She doesn't care about you.
Hang out with Rhode? Yes No
Disgusting.
You'll never learn.
You're just a pawn.
They aren't real.
Ahh... Well, that's cool too.
See you around... I guess...
Wait... REALLY?!
Yeah, why not?
I just thought you wouldn't want to stick around.
I mean... I was kind of a jerk a minute ago...
Don't worry about it. Everyone makes mistakes.
Don't worry about it.
I guess you're right... Why not?
So what did you have in mind?
Uhh...?
For hanging out?
Oh... man I'm not good at this kind of thing.
WAIT I HAVE AN IDEA!!!
Nice, what is it?
Close your eyes.
Oh come on, do it.
Alright... but I'm keeping an eye on you.
With your eyes closed?
Now open your eyes again.
Heh...
Something wrong?
Not at all...
Just haven't taken a minute to relax in a while.
I like to come out here when I'm stressed out.
Helps to get my mind off things for a little bit.
She doesn't matter.
Think about yourself.
How do you feel? She does matter.  She doesn't matter. 
How do you feel? Think about Rhode. Think about yourself.
They don't exist.
None of this does.
This changes nothing.
She isn't real.
Kind of stresses me out to be honest.
Really? We can go if you like...
No. It's fine...
Just that nagging sense of worry in the back of my head.
I think everyone gets that once in a while.
You know... maybe you're right.
I really think I needed this.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
So... how are you?
I'm doing pretty ok, I guess...
I mean... I think I can be a little too hard on myself sometimes.
I can too. It's tough not to be.
Really?
Of course...
It's easy to beat yourself up.
You know where all your weak points are.
You know... I never thought about it that way...
Heh... yeah me either.
Hey, you think I could ask you something pretty serious?
I guess?
So, you know Fern... right?
Yes?
What do you think about her?
What do you think about Fern? She seems pretty ok. I don't really like her.
You really think so?
I guess? We just met but she seems pretty nice.
That makes sense...
Are you ok?
You seem kinda... sweaty.
TOTALLY FINE!!!
Uhh...
I DEFINITELY DON'T HAVE A CRUSH ON HER OR ANYTHING!!!
You sure about that?
NO!
YES!
I don't know...
Well when you figure it out let me know.
Alright I do, but I don't know how to tell her.
Ahh yeah... that makes sense.
You ok...?
Don't worry about it.
What should Rhode do? Follow your heart. Better just play it safe.
She's going to get hurt.
It's your fault.
That's it.
Push her away.
Have you tried telling her?
No...
Maybe you should start there.
What if she doesn't like
