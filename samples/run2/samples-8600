She?
Are you... really dead?
Yeah... I guess?
If I'm not then what is this place?
Like, look at those things.
The heck is that? Honestly...
I try not to think about them...
Yeah... maybe that's for the best.
When we went to lunch you didn't fill a single basket.
Yeah and I told you it wasn't my fault.
You try catching a bunch of stuff with a basket on your head.
Huh... I never thought about it that way.
Well maybe you should start.
Yeah and you said not to!
Yeah well...
Yeah well no.
You made that choice.
You told me to do this.
You chose to listen.
What...?
Why do you need someone else to tell you who to love?
Why is that my choice?
I...
Look...
Maybe I lied...
And maybe I feel bad about it...
Maybe isn't a great answer here.
Well... maybe is all I've got right now.
Hey look...
All of this...
It's just a lot.
I'm sorry, bud.
I'm sorry too...
It's water under the bridge.
Uhh... bad analogy considering how I went out but you get the idea.
So like... time for a new job!
Well... new job! Alright so now we're focusing on the watch.
Wait... we're focusing on the watch?
Yeah... wait... we're focusing on... the computer.
Wait... do you want to blow my candles?
Heh... yeah kinda started a fire a few years ago.
Hey... you alright?
OH! Sorry... I shouldn't be here.
Don't worry about it. What's up?
Have fun!
You're hurt?
I know what you're doing.
So what do you think I should do...?
What are you thinking...?
You're right... I know what I did...
Don't worry about it. Let's blow this pizzeria up.
Helps to get going then.
<|endoftext|>Hey, Newhire.
You know, you're really not supposed to be here.
I get it though. You want to know.
Life is like that sometimes.
Going places we shouldn't go.
Getting answers we don't want.
Just one endless search through the void.
What... you're still here?! Don't say I didn't warn ya.
Take this... Don't tell him I sent ya.

<|endoftext|>Another toy in my domain?
You will fall with the others.
Crushed by the molten fist of a true warrior!
BURN BRIGHT BURN OUT
<|endoftext|>Such shoddy workmanship on this one.
I expected better of you brother.
Time to clean up this mess...
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU WIN YOU LOSE
<|endoftext|>There is a jar of red pickles in here. Pickles are gross! I love pickles!
A single giant eraser sits in the drawer. The word 'pencil' is printed neatly on the side.
The drawer is stuck and won't open.
It's full of... tax papers? Gross...
A tedious tower of financing books.
It's covered in silly doodles of... lizard people? Say hello to the floor lizard paper!
A humdrum heap of financing books.
The deep black bark of this thing seems to absorb all of the light around it.
Notation on the financial implications of middle management.
These aren't even pens, they're just drawn onto the table!
This thing looks pretty grabby. Definitely don't want to go near it.
White letters on red paper... What kind of monster made this?
Books detailing the history of employees of the month. It's all the same guy until pretty recently.
The device whirrs to life with a happy jingle.
Some loose folders with scraps of paper strewn about.
A single sticky note is glued to the shelf...
The water cooler stands idly by waiting to hear untold stories of office life.
Small multi-colored papers litter the board. The words seem to shift as you try to read them.
A sock note is pinned to the board. Informative!
The handle rattles but the door remains
