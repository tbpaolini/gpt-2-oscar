Terrifying... but he didn't make it.
You quickly pocket a large stone apple.
The price for it was you.
It's smell is ridiculous.
A meager blessing in disguise.
An extra layer of control if you experience emergencies.
Perplexing how this can happen.
Considering how things could go wrong.
However...fear instilling fear in others.
Fear that others will think the same if it sees this.
This is nothing...
It has to stop making decisions.
It is doing this.
Step forward...
I am not an eye for an eye, my name is Lorcan.
What...you're not an eye for an eye?
Look out for it!
Well that's not very nice...
Good luck out there.
Hopefully my name is right...
That means it's food for thought.
You're not up for it yet.
Seeya, Newhire!
Well, take this...
What...?
Tap into space...
You're stronger than this thing.
Newhire...
He died and you are very few...
I have many paths...many types...
You can't run them...
Don't worry about it...
I'll try...
He was right...
I would have gone alone to find him.
I'm not dangerous...
They found your missing shoe skin...
You were probably scared off by the old man before you went out.
I'm pretty sure you're pretty alright.
You both are but you're not as strong as you seem.
Maybe you're not as strong as you thought.
I'll try...
He was right...
I'm stronger than that...
I don't know how I am.
All you did was make me feel bad...
That's the way of things.
Keep going...
You did this.
You chose this.
You don't know what you're capable of.
You aren't strong enough.
Or strong enough of you.
Or strong enough of you.
Or strong enough of you.
Or strong enough of you.
Oh wow...
You could have saved him.
The thought made me even more repulsed.
Apologize? Yes Yes
Thank you for your action.
I would have done the same thing myself.
You know where I'm at though...
It all starts with you.
That's it...
Unfortunate...
That was a busy day for IT.
We shall see.
I... I see...
How things turned out then.
It's not that I was wrong...
I'm glad you reconsidered.
At least you regret everything well.
You should have listened to me.
You should have paid more attention to what was going on.
At least you're right...
I... I don't know how...
You're wrong.
You're a sadist.
Show me how wrong you are.
I do realize how messed up your whole family thought it was but...
You're just that wrong.
I'm sorry Lore?
Yes?
I don't know what you're talking about but...
When you went to get rid of Marius Marius you had a lot going for you.
I just don't know how...
What do you think I should do differently?
I should have stuck with my gut.
I should have stuck with my heart.
I think everyone does sometimes.
When you went to get rid of Marius you had a lot going for you.
I just don't know how.
That's the problem though...
I don't know if that's right...
I should have stuck with my gut.
I should have stuck with my heart.
I think everyone does sometimes.
When you went to get rid of Marius you had a lot going for you.
I just don't know if that's right...
I should have stuck with my gut.
I should have stuck with my heart.
That's the problem though...?
Well maybe I should be saying that.
I should have stuck with my gut.
Well maybe you should be saying that.
Yeah... maybe.
Well maybe you should be saying that.
What?
I got it.
First thing I do is run.
Wait... what?
Don't worry about it.
I'm not good enough...
Second thing... I just got a dollar and a half out of the dollar store.
What...?
Half a dollar?
You're still not good enough?
I-I don't think I caught what you got.
Now stop... I'm not coming back here.
This whole thing has scared me away.
Pensonade isn't coming back here.
Marius isn't here.
You alright, dude?
Yeah
