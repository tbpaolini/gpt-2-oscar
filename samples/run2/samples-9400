======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 All of them are empty.
I chose these.
I don't even know why.
But I chose these because of the way you look.
Auntie Farts fill the air of home.
A large pile of books.
Farts fill the air of book sale.
A large pile of books.
Oh, you're going to need them.
Oh, you're going to need them.
<|endoftext|>Look at you.
This is just a trick question.
The other man is a real jerk.
Newhire is doing a lot better than he should.
He needs to be keeping away from the cooler parts of the office.
Duck? What's that?
You found a hard working sock! Thanks, dude.
Thanks for work! Let's go Hacker!
You found a hard working sock! What do you need?
Here's some coffee! I'm not a real person cup shop.
That's a FACT! They both is correct.
I'm a partial a real person and a partial a fictional one.
Clearly someone works in the coffee shop and is a real person.
Clearly someone else is working in the coffee shop and is a real person.
Probably a minute there.

So, you found a hard working coffee table. What do you need?
A shelf for your books.
A few scattered around.
It's a big bookcase.
It's a tiny one.
It's a shelf for one.
You could get kind of cold reception if you take a nap.
It's a cozy pile.
It's a few pours from the bottom of the can.
It's a few have broken down and are needed as a waste of resources.
A few of them are still hot after some use.
Some are still cold after a long hard use.
Some are just too cold to drink.
A few of them are totally full of potions.
Why would you have to keep pouring?
It always boils out when you drink it.
It's a grumpy looking table.
A pile of books.
Hey, do you want some?
Hey, do you want some?
Yeah, I'm out of here.
Wait... where are you going?
I'm going back to bed. That's life.
That's what I wanted...
That's what I did.
Then it was taken from me.
That's when I met you.
That's when I met...
The chill of the night.
The leaves are still on the table.
You exactly is not doing anything to be found.
That's when I... uhh...
Just gave it the go-ahead.
Good.
You're learning your place.
Nothing out of the ordinary. Well... ordinary for this place anyway.
Ahh... maybe I'm just overthinking things then.
I'll let you know if I see anything though!
That's pretty rad of you. Thanks, dude.
Don't worry about it. I know how hard things can be sometimes.
Well... I think we should head back.
We should get out of here. I got stuff to do!
Everything ok?
Yeah... Don't worry about it.
Alright. Let's go then.
Yeah everything is definitely ok.
Awesome. Let's go.
Sure thing, I'll meet you back at the house.
Finally caught up to you.
Rhode...?
They used to say horrible things happened out here.
What are you talking about...?
Back before he pushed you out.
This isn't right... It's not real...
You're faster than you look!
I... what...?
Are you alright?
Yeah, sorry... Just kinda phased out for a minute there.
Don't worry about it. We all deal with things in our own ways.
So... what are we doing out here?
Hunting.
Hunting for what exactly?
For a very rare and... tasty looking creature.
You don't say...
I do say.
In fact... I'm looking at it...
right...
NOW!!!
ENRAGED CLUCKING
WHARRGARBL!!!
There it is...
Wait... what?
Grab the food pods... Before it escapes...
Food pods?
RUN, YOU FOOL!!!
It's been busy.
You again...
This one knows us, dear brother.
It may not wish to, dear sister.
Well, you're right about that.
How unfortunate for it.
We shall see.
In time.
I don't need your pity.
Hello again, little one.
You again...
It recognizes us, dear sister.
It matters not, dear brother.
You don't get to
