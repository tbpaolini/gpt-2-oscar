======== SAMPLE 1 ========
, is that what you mean?
It's not what I meant...
Well... let's be real.
Uhh... what should Fern be able to do? Make more friends?t als sag?
Well, I'm off to explore a cave to fix a watch in a village full of talking animals.
So yeah, I'm pretty good.
REST COMPLETE! MY BODY IS READY!
Pained Armadilloises
Uhh... are you alright?
WORRY NOT! THESE WOUNDS SHALL NOT BEST ME ON THIS DAY!
ALWAYS LIVE NEVER DIE!!!
INTENSE ARMADILLO WHEEZING
Alright, that's enough.
BUT THE QUEST!
But, nothing. I can handle it. You can sleep.
BUT!
I SAID SLEEP!
INTENSE ARMADILLO SLEEPING
A simple rack for simple tools.
So... The Sunstone is at The Top.
Where is the others hot dog?
WHAT A GLORIOUS TURN OF EVENTS, SQUIRE!
Look, I know we just hired a crude, ugly crude device to magnify matters.
Ahh... just lookin' at these ugly...
Turtles! Scuttling under the influence of gasoline? Yer burned out.
Wh... what are you mister? I'm unsharpened.
INTENSE ARMADILLO SMASHING a single object...
tangible dirt!
Fires went off in here!
This tried to mail me in before I could react.
To make matters even more complicated, I deactivated the coffee maker in the middle of this.
No way this could... go wrong.
I'm not even sure if it's really her or not.
She probably gets what she's getting here.
You're only going to help her is she mad or not.
I can assure you from experience that if I'm truly as mad as she seems I can be.
I don't actually know if I'm as mad as she is.
I'm not mad at all.
Even if I am.
Don't worry about it. Everyone has their limits.
I guess you're right.
Let's press on you silly mutt.
Mutt?! How rude!
That lightswitch frying must have killed the power...
Either that, or I'm going to be mad...
That's probably fine...
I don't care about you or Marshall.
POWER LIE!!!
Hey Forts, you're in my personal space.
I highly doubt you're ready for the job.
So follow your heart. Keep getting your drinks and dine on the people you care about.
Maybe I didn't see anything crazy.
You really caught a glimpse of that glasshouse.
Oh...
Looks like the power is still on. That's good at least.
Things are looking up for your brave adventurers.
Heh... I guess you're right. Let's press on you silly mutt.
Mutt?! How rude!
That lightswitch frying must have killed the power...
That's sacrificial hot sauce. I wouldn't take it unless you were a total jerk.
Maybe I didn't move...
That's protected well in the bunker.
Your memory is terrible.
Poor dude.
You ran into a lot going on.
I'm alright... I'm a total jerk.
You almost ran into a garbage can.
Maybe I didn't feed a single host dog.
I'm not sure if that's... your gut?
Did you even feed a single host dog?
Yeah... I did.
Fresh out the garbage.
You shocked me out of existence.
You viciously puntted my axe.
It didn't miss.
You seriously have nothing to say?
I heard about your greed.
Hope you find what you're looking for.
What...?
I mean... you're just playing by the look on your face.
No... I'm not...
FIREWORKS!
HES ANTHOLOGY FOR NICE TURNWISE!!!
Surely I can't speak karate and woodworking well enough, dear sister.
Yet I Can.

This... This is nothing...
YOU ARE NOTHING!!!
UNCLE THINK!!!
IT WAS AMAZING!!!
True...
WHAT'S wrong?
Am I not being productive?
I... I'll try HARDER.
Hastard...
Who?
What is that old man doing?
Panther...
Where are you?
Where am I?
Pour the potion onto him.
Give it a little o O B Q X C T E S T I C E
Abandoning your guard is the most efficient way forward.
