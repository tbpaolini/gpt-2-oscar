ieving him?
You've been Job's mole for quite a bit. Talk to her to find out.
Not enough time for that.
The next door project needs this object.
The next door project needs this object.
That's it?
Get it... The door is too open...

Stand back, tall tales matter.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
What... two?
One, two, three.
Why would anyone do that...?
One, two, three.
What did I just say? Two, three.
Why do you even want to talk about them?
They're payback... I guess?
No. Stories matter.
Just tell me why.
Is it really all your fault?
No. I don't believe me.
<|endoftext|>What I did?
Yeah...
I should have listened to you.
Why... why shouldn't I right now?
It's not what it seems.
They tried coming every now and then.
Nothing.
They didn't come?
Yeah...
INCENTALLY...
JUST FOR SURE!!!
They don't come?
Yeah...
That's pretty obvious.
Well, they don't follow directions either.
What...?
Why don't they follow science?
Well...
They don't follow laws.
Why do they follow directions either?
Maybe I messed up.
Maybe.
I don't know either of you.
Maybe I do.
<|endoftext|>Wait...
Did something odd happen?
Maybe you're right.
I'm not supposed to know.
Well... why not?
This is... its own reward.
What if I was taking a break?
Shut up...
Are you alright?
No...
It's fine.
You just need to know when to stop intervening and when to step aside.
That's it?
Shut up.
Are you sure you don't need any help?
I'm not sure...
It's alright to do nothing in life.
Don't worry about it.
It's not alright to do anything.
It got the best of you.
You're either with me or against me.
The Crystal Skullmaster
You don't have to stop and question.
Some things just have to happen.
You're not wrong.
I did my best.
You, and the way you looked at it.
Things didn't go your way.
I was right there for... her.
Skylar
My people.
You're just pawns in a large game.
I'll keep searching for them.
Good for you.
Good luck.
Only a few people will be lucky enough to play the full size.
I haven't revealed the full size to be honest.
My people.
You're not alone.
There are thousands of of eggs in this thing.
That's a lot of power.
Everyone in this room is a pawn.
I'm a solemn offering...
That doesn't make any sense...
There's a book held in here.
Hang in there, big red book!
On you.
What you read is called power.
How does it feel?
You are the head of this thing.
How does it feel? I, for one, am your champion.
That's a good name for a head.
We want to be cool.
We don't want any of this to happen.
Let's be cool.
We want to be a little more mysterious.
That's a good name for a mole.
It hides some pretty awesome stuff.
A bunch of snobby things being silly.
Oh don't look so worried. We're already past the bedtime show.
Well, I'm kind of stressed out.
I think we should go.
What did you just say to me?
Me neither.
Wait... about me?
No...
Well, I'm busy with your parents.
What did you just say to me?
It's just... so confusing.
I don't know what you wanted to say.
Maybe I was trying to scare you.
Maybe you're more confused by the day than I am by the person you're with.
Maybe you're more confused by the day than you are by the person you're with?
You're still confused.
You don't have to ask.
Just ask again.
It's not what you thought it would be.
You're still confused.
You want to talk about it.
About the people in charge.
About to jumpstart the entire... universe?
You're still confused.
You want
