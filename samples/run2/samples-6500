Welcome to The Watercooler. Chairs have been removed to improve productivity. -The Management
Hey, you're in my personal space.
Stay out of my personal space.
Keep away from my personal space.
Personal space.
Dude, seriously. PERSONAL SPACE.
Thank you for respecting my personal space.
Hey, stay away from my coffees.
How come The Management lets you drink two coffees?
Because I'm freakin' awesome.
This guy is way too awesome to talk to.
Tower Corp is out to get me but I feel alright.
I get up and have a cup of coffee.
On my way to work I have a cup of coffee.
When I get to work I have a cup of coffee.
I live here.
He seems pretty well adjusted.
That's not enough cash for a coffee.
Oh...
Don't look so down. You could always try the vending machine.
Thanks, Whistler.
A beautiful handbag... The strap breaks when you lift it.
A deliciously painful memory is tied to that object.
Where are you...?
Wherever I like.
Well... nobody said you could talk.
Stop me then.
I... I don't know how...
Good. Embrace that helpless feeling.
Now pick up the object.
Alright...
Hold it tightly and close your eyes.
What... was that...?
Something painful. Something hidden. Gnawing its way forward.
I... I don't know.
Maybe.
Show me the object.
Look for what?
Coffee cabinet. Come back with your creation.
I don't know what you expected.
Maybe.
Something terrifyingly familiar.
It's...
Something warm.
 Come sit down!
Hurt them.
Make them pay.
Make them pay? Let me know.
Let me know.
You just sent a mixed response.
fear, conviction, and hate.
All mixed results.
You never showed any resistance.
Let me guess...
What kind of object the object is?
You're not listening to me.
Hey, you actually caught the object?
No...
Hey, look at all your ducks.
What...?
This is what the game looks like.
Well... I guess you're right.
You're right.
Kind of stops you in your tracks.
Just one more obstacle before you hit the open field.
Hurt them.
Make them pay.
Make them pay? Let's make this right?
You don't have to do this. Don't give up.
I don't want this. I want this.
It sticks to the stick.
Yeah you do.
This is your chance.
Stand back.
watch.
ense.
Wait...
are you sure you don't want to pay?
Of course I won't let you remove my favorite hat.
Things are looking up for our brave adventurers.
Haven't you done your due diligence.
Well... I wouldn't put it past you.
You.
Stand back.
watch.
無首是真不要想要想要想要想要無首明 You don't have the strength to move.
You are very strong.
There is a sound that fills the air.
It is heard again.
More like 7:47 a.m.
You can't be here.
There is a soft sound coming from under the covers.
Weakened...
You can't be here.
We need to leave.
This is your fault. You're right.
You're right.
I... I don't know how...
Stay here.
Clean up after yourself.
And then we'll go see The Watercooler?
No way...
We'll let you know if you're not back by midnight.
That's not very nice...
On our way, friend.
So like... time.
Turn around, kid.
Sleeping is dangerous.
You're more than a bit intrusive.
What... you're really here?
I mean... you really didn't have a choice.
You're pretty terrible...
Just... just give up.
You know what...? Don't worry.

Destroying everything in your path.
You'll never find him.
He's at the bottom of the mine.
