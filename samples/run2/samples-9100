======== SAMPLE 1 ========

The guards are looking extremely uneasy.
The air is cold and clings to your skin.
This must be the place.
Every page says... 'REST COMPLETE'.
The device is destroyed... But what was that for?
Rest in the soft grass? No Yes
<|endoftext|>YOU GREAT FOOL!!!
HOW COULD YOU RAISE ARMS AGAINST AN INNOCENT?!
Uh... Emelio...?
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?!
EMELIO!!!
WHAT?!
I... Uh...
Disappointed Armadilloises
I can just go. You seem a bit... occupied.
I'm not going to let you hurt me again.
Wait... Please tell me what you require.
Are you sure?
Yes... I have failed you twice already.
Alright... Ramul told me to stop by and ask you about fixing this watch.
A noble quest...
WE WILL LEAVE AT ONCE!!!
Wait... we?
With you as my squire we will conquer this challenge.
Uh... squire?
QUICKLY NOW!!!
How do I keep getting into these situations...
A strange offering to untold entities.
A shrine to Misery and Mania.
A petty offering to false gods.
Simple tools worn from years of use.
A masters tools, worn with years of use.
Ancient and dusty tools. Why would anyone use these?
A strange assortment of minerals and crystals.
Fantastic treasures from untold adventures beneath the earth.
Dust collectors litter the table.
Crystalline structures fill the two stones.
These would look really pretty with the right light on them.
A few colored stones sit on the shelf.
A bunch of small parts waiting for Emelio to use them.
Tiny pieces waiting to be part of something greater.
One big task ahead of Emelio.
Hang in there! You're all set!
Alright... I'll be right back!
So there you go! You ready to go?
Yeah... I'm all done here.
So what do you want?
A clockwork moon?
Alright so I'm gonna give you a little sunburn.

Well I'm not gonna' let you hurt you...
You're kind of scaring me...
Wake up Lore.
We need to get going.
Seal the wayward baby's...
Wake up and be thankful.
He's worthless to us.

He's worthless to the Gods.
He's even more worthless.
You'll get your chance.
Yates...

<|endoftext|>Hey, Lore.
This is CPT I took away from the raid. You should know.
This old man hides everything.
I should have told you that.
The others in the room are much better.
I'm not mad at you for that.
What are you hiding?
I can help.
Yes?
I... I will find my way.
Well, work was already hours ago...
So what's on your mind?
I'm not good at this kind of thing.
What kind of thing?
This... kind of thing?
<|endoftext|>Hey, Uhh... I don't know what I'm doing.
Here we go!
So what's on your mind?
I'm not good at this kind of thing.
This... kind of thing?
<|endoftext|>Uhh... what is that?
You know, the budget problematy.
What kind of problem is that?
There's a ledger resting on a table.
Gotta work getting those strings right.
Record the journey so far? No Yes
The ink sinks into the page and fades out. Your progress has been saved.
The place feels cozy and warm.
Staring at the strange object you faint your nod.
Not your place, dear brother.
Holding onto it tightly.
I don't know what you expected.
It to be this?
It didn't feel like anything.
<|endoftext|>Bah...
Thanks for the life lesson.
What are you waiting
