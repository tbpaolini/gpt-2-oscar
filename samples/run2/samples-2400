Hey, Liebel!

Welcome to the next floor. Don't get in the way.
The edges of the... book... fallow books sit too... low to read.
Oh, I definitely know what you're doing.
Well... don't give up yet...
You have a great time.
Just a little farther afield... than you're knowlingc... you're probably a little farther afield.
You know... I never thought about it that way...
It's not that I...
It's... but for the fact...
You have a great time.
Just a little farther afield... than you're a little farther afield.
You know... I never thought about it that way...
It's not that I...

It's just that you're not ready.
I Done That!
Well... yeah.
Yeah...
Well no.
Yeah...
Sorry...
Don't worry about it.
I guess you're right...
Well... yeah.
Sorry for asking.
I gotta get back to the lab. Upstate...
This isn't the worst thing you've done...
You're right. It is.
Oh... sorry.
Any time.
I should probably get going. It's late...
It's late at night.
I... I don't know how...
Come sit down! It's time to get out of here.
What are you doing!
I don't know if I would say this but I am onto someone.
You really are, dear brother.
There's a large corrosive in every door.

Hey, that's ok. You can't do that.
Hey, that's not what I wanted...
OH! I'M SPEAKING AT YOU!!!
You can't even CLIMATE THE THING!
You CAN!
it's already started!
So... what now?
You'll have to figure that out on your own.
Wait... what?
Make your way around the well. I'll see you on the next floor!
You're already pretty tough on my tough bits.
Not very tough.
You can definitely COCKKNOW your way around the register.
