ower, it's a painting of a stormy forest.
The storm is setting.
Hey... Waffle?
Hey! It's a new job here at Feast! Have fun, Flourishful Guy!
I kind of I. Have a cookie for lunch.
Alright. I know...
You're obviously not a cookie cutter.
You're a good enough cookie to eat the rest of the sandwich?
I get it. You've got a mean streak in you.
Thanks, don't do anything about it.
Well... I guess it's company tax that counts?
Hey! How are you?
I'm pretty good.
Well, I think I'm through.
Yeah, really?
You again?
Me?
Then any time.
This isn't right...
Good for you.
Now let's get you a hat.
Hate coffee? Watch that thing go...
Doesn't matter.
Come on.
The hat is paid for well.
Looks like 4C is open. Right next to that weird shirt guy. Have fun with the rest of your career!
Time for some IT work! First row on the left. Don't be late!
Go play with your food! Second row on the left. Don't be late!
You ready to go yet?
You definitely can't miss a beat.
What is this?
It's a pocketwatch. So you can give it a shot fixed on fire.
I'm a computer! That's pretty awesome.
That's it! You're expert.
Hit the play-through button. The game is still running.
What did you do here?
Defeatly written in capital 'A'.
That's it! You made it!
Thanks for helping him do his job.
He doesn't even have a phone.
That's all it took.
Thanks for helping him forget about his job.
He doesn't even have a computer.
Pffff... yeah he does.
<|endoftext|>hey look! It's Firestone. Daughter of Sif. Founder of The Tower. Leader of the best in my books.
That's pretty awesome.
Hey, dad?
Yes?
Well, I'm gonna give you a diamond.
What do you want?
A diamond.
A crown.
And that's a lie.
I know...
You're just shy.
Is that all you've got?
Shy...
All of this talking?
You're not a monster.
None of this.
What are you talking about?
Eater for a feathered duochrome.
What?
You found a sock.
Oh...
Thanks!
A beautiful sock.
A beautiful sock.
So...
A bunch of Westeros' most beautiful and vivacious animals.
There's a ledger resting on a table. Strange symbols litter the pages.
White letters on red... What kind of monster made this?
A bunch of Waterford's.
One for each of the animals.
It's full of advice on how to treat its contents.
What kind of monster made this?
A bunch of Fern's?
Fish...
One for each of the animals?
No.
Is there anyone here who doesn't want to eat soup?
Pour... beer... meat... food... into the sea?
No.
Is that why you call it a monster?
Maybe.
Is this really all a misunderstanding?
What...?
Hope you find what you're looking for.
The storm is getting worse.
There's a jar of red pickled pickles in here.
It's brand new.
A bunch of empty jars.
This is what life is like on this planet.
There's a roll of toilet paper stuck to the floor.
You're fired?
I'm not a worker, Erin.
Let me guess, picky eater Joe.
That's alright.
You're fired too.
Are you prepared then?
It's the new guy here! He's always going to be a super sucky.
Thank you, picky eater Joe.
Why do you have to be the new guy here?
I... I don't know. I better get used to it.
Let's get you an office here. Sounds good.
Alright, time for you to go buddy.
Thanks.
Yeah I don't have all day.
This thing isghastly.
It must be headed out.
We must secure our own destiny.
Perhaps.
We are the New Hererses, and I decide what path leads to... BATTLE!
Let's get you home.
Sure...
I believe in you.
So now you must face your pasts.
How do you respond to what you don
