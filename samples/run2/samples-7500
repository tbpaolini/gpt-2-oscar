 THARDOWER.
How long have you been waiting...?
No, I don't think I was even there...
You're right. I was.
Wait... really?
I mean... really.
YOU ARE A SASS WATCH!
Yeah... yeah...
THE SASSISTOR!
WHAT'S wrong?
ISMENTAL VIKING BODY!
Are you...
THE MASTER?
NO!!!
I SAID SLEEP!!!
A strange object blocks your path.
What...?
I don't know...
What will happen if I continue?
What if I don't move?
This way... nothing?
I don't know...
What if I don't move at all?
This...
Could it be that someone is watching?
This is really only a dream...
A thin wall of sound transmits...
A WHOLE SLED OF YOU!!!
A WHOLE TURN!!!
You feel a strange liquid form.
A sticky liquid form.
You feel a strange liquid form.(Niflheim)...
A WHOLE SLED OF YOU!!!
A WHOLE TURN!!!
I don't know what you expected.
Maybe I expected you to be more sarcastic.
Maybe?
Yes.
Your decision to side with Baron has unintended consequences.
Chaotic...
What...?
It's just a nightmare...
You can't be here...
How do you know?
You wouldn't give it away...
It was only a dream...
What if I was wrong?
Then you would be right.
But don't say that to me.
I am more than a dream...
A certain wily plant called Druidic Knowledge.
Who... is this?
It's my dear old man. He always seems to be on the top of his game.
I'm not a player, dear old man.
I just know what I'm getting into.
What...?
Where is the OTHER ONE?
IOxygen...
What...?
You've just robbed me of that chance.
What if I'm going to live?
Will this even be possible?
Is this even possible?
I hope so...
Let's take it step by step.
One... Two... Ducks?
ORYGHEN!
I see...
A large stone whale blocks your path. It's cute in a grumpy sort of way.
Why would you do that?
Whistler... What...?
Whistling?
A small red whale sits before you. It's cute in a grumpy and vandalized sort of way.
What are you doing here?
I should have listened to you.
I should have seen it coming.
It's full of whale bones.
That's not a whale.
It's not a whale.
I'M NOT A WHITMAN!
That's not a whale.
It's full of whale bones.
That's not a whale.
That's not a whale.
Yeah... I guess you're right.
Well, what did you need me to say?
In a word...
Yeah. I'm Rick.
Hello again, little one.
You're Lore?
RYAN MAN I am, Lore.
Yes, dear brother.
What do you think I'm trying to say?
It looks like it's going to be ok.
I aren't talking about it being ok.
I know. You're right.
The whale bones indicate something.
Nothing to indicate yet.
I'll let you know if I see anything.
Alright, time for you to be deleted.
How do I leave?
Right, good luck getting onto this thing.
What if I don't?
How do you know my name?
I mean... I've been doing this for years.
You really thought you wouldn't ask?
Yeah... I was thinking about it then.
I mean... I'm sure.
So maybe it's not?
Yeah... it's just a memory...
And that's what I'm here for.
You know what?
Yeah... I guess?
I mean... not really.
Have you tried taking vitamins?
No...
Well... not really.
You're kind of scaring me... isn't it?
I guess not?
So what do you want?
Ramen?
What...?
A問込
What do you mean?
Well... it feels good.
I mean... it's not good at all.
You're making a lot of money doing this.
Seriously?
Just a few pennies.
Oh... and do you need anything further?
Nah... just want to grab a nap for a minute.
Alright.
Thanks.
Think I can help?
He's already done
