======== SAMPLE 1 ========

Well... this one's a bit more complicated.
What...?
What did you just say?!
I SAID STOP FAIRY AND HAVING!!!
You're clearly too late.
So... what's going on?
I...
I mean...
you...
Are you alright?
Nope.
What do you mean?
I mean...
I said...
ARE YOU OK?
YES!
now let's go.
Wait...

Why?'
are you mean?
if...
Then we're done.
Wait...

Why...?

We're finished.

So we don't go further than here?
Of course we don't go further than here!
Why are you saying that...?
I...
Wash your wounds...
Thank you.
wait...
wait...
Wash your...
ah...
Ahh...
Maybe I...
Don't say this...
I do say that.
No...
I'm not ready.

Hey, you're in my signature drawing!
I saw that.
I'll pass...
Good. Draw another one?
Yep!
So... what do you think I can do?
What can I?
Just, give it a shot.
Let me know what you think!
Like what? Don't want to give in.
Who?
Tell me.
About the right idea.
Heck yeah.
What if I was on his tail?
Same as with you?
Same as with you?
You really should ask though.
Would it bother you?
Not really...t it bothered you...
You could always just trust me.
That's kind of what Karissa did, right?
WeCan do anything.
We are in charge.
We put pressure on her.
Then she took the chance.
So yeah...
What do you think about it?
Pushed?
Did she?
I mean...
I don't think so...
She didn't just take that chance on me.
People she knows.
We follow the law.
We follow the same code.
Everything she does.
We know exactly what's going to happen.
Why?
She's not ready.
Not yet.
It's going to be pretty.
It is now, stranger creatures, with stronger holdouts.
When the power goes out...
Oh yeah... Tower Corpians resources.
They go out on a limbic merry-go-round...
Not to the faint of heart's delight.
About the only problem...
She's not ready.
You'll understand when you get over this hump.
Well yeah... I guess?
I mean...
You could say that.
You're right. I am.
What...?
This isn't funny...
You're joking again...
Theta...t...t...t...t...t...t...
It is...
An invisible pocket sits uneaively upon all of us.
It's only right that you should know it.
It's a... cactus...?
It's a... cactus.
It's a cactus.
True...?
Yes True...
It's a metaphor for me.
A little table sits uneasily upon the terrace.
Nothing...
A book is held tightly to the shelf.
It's a simple yet effective night light.
Light floods in slowly.
The bed seems to relax all around.
I don't know if it is because the light is that important...
It's a bit rough on the tongue...
It's a bit hard on the eyes.
Neat isn't all.
Not enough...
To name a few...
What...?
Bend it around?...
Don't worry about it.
He's taking care of the rest.
I've got some work to do, kiddo.
Will you begin?
That's enough.
Start with the woodwork?
Yes.
Can you make it to the other side first?
They're already starting.
Alright... I'll start.
The woodworking rests perfectly.
The only problem is... it's kind of a leap of faith.
You've got a beard. You're going to keep doing it.
Do you need more...?
I-I can't do this alone.
I don't need any help.

... CATCH ME CATCH ME
Hrm... CATCH ME CATCH ME
Well... You did great...
You stop and think...
That way helps to think about how things are going...
More thoughts help to think...
A bit of advice...
A little prophecy...
A little guide for those who
