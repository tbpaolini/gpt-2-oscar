======== SAMPLE 1 ========
't have his back...
He's going to be ok.
You're definitely not ready for battle.
Just have to know you can do it.
You're done for.
That's it... just give me a minute.
Hey, isn't this music groovy?
Sound good?
Yeah... I guess?
Show me why I have this...
Why do you need someone else to tell you what to do?
Are you ready for what?
It's time for me to step into the forwardhole.
Alright... I gotta get rid of this thing.
Wait... did he just... MOVE?!
Nah. Couldn't be.
OH MAN HE TOTALLY MOVED!!!
HES A ZOMBIE FOR SURE!!!
Blurgghhhh...
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!
STAY AWAY ZOMBIE!!!
I'm not a zombie.
YOU'RE TOTALLY A ZOMBIE!!!
I'M NOT A ZOMBIE!!!
Hrm... Prove it then.
How am I supposed to do that?
Logic puzzle.
Logic puzzle?
Continue this pattern... One, Two, X?
One, Two, X? Three Potato Brains Oatmeal
Huh... Alright then. I believe you.
Nice.
I've still got my eye on you though.
I can't even see your eyes...
That makes two of us.
Seriously?
Yep.
Fine... I believe you.
You do?
Yep.
Why?
If you really ate brains you'd be way smarter.
Ok... you're obviously not a zombie.
How do you know?
You wouldn't give it away that easy.
Maybe I'm a clever zombie.
Pffff... You? Nah.
One... Two... OATMEAL...?!
Yes.
Who made you this way?
I did. I'm simple like that.
Fine... I believe you.
Seriously...?
Nope.
So what happened anyway?
Someone ran into you and knocked you out.
Someone...?
Someone.
And then someone brought me in here?
Yep.
Fine... I believe you.
You're not a zombie.
Who brought you in here?
I'm not a zombie.
Anyway... You know what...? Fine.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry you didn't feel better.
I didn't mean to invade your privacy.
I wanted to blame it on you.
I didn't mean to invade your trust.
I did... I paid for it.
You... you don't know what you did.
I did... I didn't stand a chance.
I don't know what you did.
You just had to give.
I don't know what you did.
And that's a pretty big price to pay.
You're not even sure what you did there.
What...?
You're still not sure.
Maybe if you could just go?
What if I'm not going to give you a second chance?
What if I'm going to give you a second chance?
You're not going to get one?
Are you joking...
No...
 or something?
What if I'm going to give you a second chance?
You're not going to get one?
You know what?
I don't know you, or Rhode.
My gut.
I've never seen it.
You're not even sure if you're familiar.
That's not very nice...
Oh... Uhhh... Sorry?
Don't worry about it.
I mean... You don't have much in the way of stamina.
That's kind of messed up...
You're right. I'm sorry.
Don't worry about it.
Are you alright?
Yeah... I just feel bad about the eggs.
You almost made it!
Just have to remember to breathe next time.
Yeah, that really wasn't easy...
You were doing awesome!
I felt like I was doing pretty alright for a minute there.
Just lost my balance running into things.
That's alright.
You did your best. That's what matters.
That's what matters.
You did your best. That's what matters.
You did your best. That's what matters?
You stole a egg by the handle. What a steal.
You stole a egg by the handle. Can you fix it?
I can fix it. I will be on my way.
Do you need help?
No...
What...?
You can help.
Yeah, that's the problem.
Yeah, I feel bad about it.
No...
I don't know what to say...
I'm sorry...
I'm sorry...
It's fine...
