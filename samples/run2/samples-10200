 Description
You took the opportunity to lie to me.
You chose to give me advice.
No, I don't think I got what I deserved.
I really should have listened to you.
You really didn't.
So... what's on your mind?
I'm not good at this kind of thing.
What kind of thing?
This... kind of thing?
Oh man...
I don't know what to say...
Well, what do you want to say?
Pretty sure you know the answer to that.
Yeah?

This thing is a lot like Nothin' My Split Weigh This.
The dream washes over you like a wet sock.
Do you want to run? Yes No

Alright, this thing is a lot better prepared for an onslaught of guises.

Oh... Come lie down!
Let's go home.
So... what now?
Well, it's a nice day... Wanna hang out for a bit?
You're wasting time.
She doesn't care about you.
Hang out with Rhode? Yes No
Disgusting.
You'll never learn.
You're just a pawn.
They aren't real.
Ahh... Well, that's cool too.
See you around... I guess...
Wait... REALLY?!
Yeah, why not?
I just thought you wouldn't want to stick around.
I mean... I was kind of a jerk a minute ago...
Don't worry about it. Everyone makes mistakes.
Don't worry about it.
I guess you're right... Why not?
So what did you have in mind?
Uhh...?
For hanging out?
Oh... man I'm not good at this kind of thing.
WAIT I HAVE AN IDEA!!!
Nice, what is it?
Close your eyes.
Oh come on, do it.
Alright... but I'm keeping an eye on you.
With your eyes closed?
Now open your eyes again.
Heh...
Something wrong?
Not at all...
Just haven't taken a minute to relax in a while.
I like to come out here when I'm stressed out.
Helps to get my mind off things for a little bit.
She doesn't matter.
Think about yourself.
How do you feel? She does matter.  She doesn't matter. 
How do you feel? Think about Rhode. Think about yourself.
They don't exist.
None of this does.
