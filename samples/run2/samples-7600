======== SAMPLE 1 ========
EN!
Hey, wake up!
HELLO!
Did you make it there?
No problem, I'm sure. Good, now you're at the bar.
So what did you have in mind?
Uhh...?
For a drink?
Oh, please. I'm over here.
Alright, time for you to go.
Why do you need help?
It's the drink of choice. -Barron
Hey, don't do this to me.
Why do you need help?
It's the same baron as me. He seems friendly.
Anyway... Take this.
Make me yours.
I love you.
That's it. Good luck out there.
Maybe this is the start of every successful story.
Are you ready for what comes next?
It's your fault.
I did this on purpose.
I didn't realize how wrong you were until you helped me.
I... help?
I don't know.
That's the spirit.
I didn't mean to.
You're right. I'm sorry.
I don't have any complaints to report.
What did you report?
To a random table.
Where do you think the Newhire Executive is rated?
Newhire Executive: 3
Newhire Executive: A+
An F-Fighter?
Newhire Executive: B
An F-Fighter?
Newhire Executive: B
Why?
Why are you here?
Why did you help him?
I couldn't be here without you.
Why do you hate me?
I don't know.
That's enough.
Fine...
Get off of me.
I understand.
Justin, you can't hurt them.
Arrogant... and you're not pushing me away.
Are you sure you don't want to go?
Why would I want to go?
You'll see, silly.
What if I don't?
What if I don't?
You'll understand.
No...
You don't...
I don't know how...

This is your fault.
You did this on purpose.
Newhire Executive: 4
Newhire Executive: B
An F-Fighter?
Newhire Executive Executive: A
An Eater of Hope?
Newhire Executive: A
No...
You don't have anything better.
I'm not even an F-Fighter.
Uhh... hey, you're in my way.
How did you know?
I just...
wore a red hat.
What is that?
You fed a lot of hungry ghosts.
Youh... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
Don't worry about it. You ready to go?
Sure... sure. What's the plan, buddy?
FORGIVE ME!!!
The ghostly flames burst from the can.
The small fragment of metal sinks into the wood before hitting the floor.
What... did you just say?
It wouldn't feel right...
It should have been silent.
Then...
It's not real...
You're right.
You're right.
What...?
When I was a kid, I never thought I'd be caught.
You're correct...
You're also wrong.
At the time...
You didn't have the strength to look away.
What are you talking about...?
You didn't even have the strength to look away.
Then you're wrong...
I lied to you.
I chose the wrong path.
I don't know what...
Good grief...
You're still alive...
You know what?
I can't talk anymore...
You're too old to talk.
You can talk anymore...... but not anymore...
I can't remember any time either...
You know what?
You're right.
I'm sorry...
I didn't mean to.
I know better than to...
That simple.
A Newhire's A Better Member...
Newhire Executive: Newhire is like a ghost.
They don't know what they're doing anymore.
They just want to go home.
Newhire'll now begin to feel like a ghost.
Newhire will now begin to believe in you.
Newhire will now begin to feel like a ghost.
You really think you're not real?
I'm not going to give up on you.
That's the spirit.
Get over here already.
<|endoftext|>There's a huge slash across the back...
It's too stormy to see anything...
Light Amplify Banish
You look scared out here.
No way I could lift this off of your mind...
Hold onto him for now. A little help will do.
He's too dangerous to access here.
No...
