.
You found a fine yet sticky egg by mistake.
I'VE GOT AN AXE!
I... uhh...
It's a Peho named Topher called by the fish?
Yes.
My name is Terry. I run The Water Life Company.
My company name?
Tire company.
Not your time. company.
My time.
Company.
How long do you think it will take you?
Nothing.
Is this what you want?
Good luck.
You'll see.
Why not?
It's her.
.
She doesn't deserve this.
Fine.
I don't think I can handle her.
Fine...
Fine I will.
You'll understand when it's over.
You'll be on your own.
I'm the one who sent you here.
You're right, seriously.
HOW COULD YOU LET HER DOWN?
Look, I know you're hurting now.
But I'm not denying that you're stronger than her.
I just...
Are you sure?
 Sure.
What?
Is this what you wanted?
It's going to be ok?
It may be... but I'm not ready for it yet.
Are you ready for it yet?
Yeah...
I need to find peace in myself and my passion for nature.
So... how do you do that?
Pressurise the Timeline.
Look at you Print Water The End of the Line. Not The Other One.
You're doing awesome. Hope You Two Well.
I'm glad you reconsidered.
Didn't really have a choice.
None of us do here.
Sorry...
Here's Joe's coffee. Bring him the change as well.
Alright, thanks.
You don't have to give me the change. It's private...
Wait... coffee?
It's a tiny, smelly, alcoholic concoction. I don't think I've inhaled it.
It's a tiny, smelly, alcoholic concoction. I don't think I've exhaled it.
You think coffee tastes terrible? Gross!
Disgusting.
You know what you did.
That's pretty messed up.
Did I just miss anything?
Nope.
Well, thanks.
That's pretty messed up.
You gonna give?
You made that mistake.
Same thing.
You made that mistake.
You really did.
<|endoftext|>Look at you.
Took you long enough...
Just a few mistakes here and there.
Nobody will notice... right?
Leaving just one flower...
You're pretty messed up. You know that right?
You just can't help yourself...
What an animal.
Cat got your tongue?
I... don't know what to say.
Well, that didn't stop you before.
What do you mean?
You really wanted to dig... didn't ya?
You barely knew her.
What are you talking about?
Rhode, ya dingus.
You never talked to her.
Yet you still tried to give me advice.
Well... yeah I guess.
Why?
Why did you give Fern advice? I wanted to help. I wanted to know more.
Wait... really?
Yeah...
I wasn't trying to be a jerk. Sorry if it came across that way.
Huh... that kinda changes things.
Seriously...?
Yeah...
You do realize how messed up that is right?
I mean... maybe?
You're wrong.
What...?
I talked to her before we went to lunch.
She clearly likes you.
Liked...
What...?
Where do you think we are?
What do you think this place is?
She LIKED me...
And now she's gone...
We both are...
This is your fault. You wanted to hurt her. I told you this would happen.
This is your fault. You're right...  It's not my fault. 
Wait... really?
Well I mean... yeah.
None of this would have happened if I wasn't here.
Seriously...?
All of this and you really think you're not to blame?
Well it's not the first time.
When I asked you for advice you just avoided the question.
Of course I did.
What...?
I don't know you, or Rhode. At least... not really.
How could you expect me to help you?
Well that's new.
When I asked you for advice you lied to me.
You acted like you didn't know anything about Rhode.
Except... she told you how she felt.
What's the point?
Why'd you lie?
Why did you lie about Rhodes feelings? I wanted to stay out of it
