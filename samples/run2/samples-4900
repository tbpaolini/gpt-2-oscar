 Vaporation of the Pool
You found a smelly sock. Gross!
I've never seen it.
It feels incredibly sticky.
It's full of sticky notes.
Sealed closed and locked with staples.
These papers say... 'The Future Is At The End of This'
A deliciously painful memory is tied to that object.
There's a thin line at the end of the mine.
You can't escape the mine.
<|endoftext|>I see you met Joe.
Thanks...
A beautiful handbag... The strap breaks when you lift it.
About the right size for a phone.
Not yet your cup of tea.
Leaving a note of appreciation.
Something along the lines of... You know...
<|endoftext|>Hey Joe.
About the right size for a phone.
<|endoftext|>So I'm catching up on that... Miss?
I can't remember the last time I ate anything...
Crisp and clean new information is always a pleasure to read.
The page has been prepared, you can now relax right here.
I'm glad you see things this way.
However, the path ahead can be bumpy.
One day I will be as happy as you are, but for now you will always be a prey to my wishes.
I've yet to decide what pathster you will call your own.
Leaving this one today will be no different.
For now... Keep going.
<|endoftext|>Hey Joe.
I know you can do it.
However you feel about it.
Replace Plastic Surgery.
And Trapped in the[insert image here]] for the duration of this challenge.
Do Not Disturb.
Neat phrases, little scraps of information.
Not every page in here pops when you're out here.
The machine residue still hangs around in the dark.
Some things never change...
Leave this thing alone. It will be fine.
Not this again... Stuff like this happened often.
We need to get out of here.
Of course... Leave this thing alone.
It's not even coffee.
It's... glass...
No.
No more excuses.
... You were right.
 .
 ... You told me to stop...
 ... You chose a wrong path.
 ... I did?
 .
 ... uhh...
I mean... really?
 .
 ... What do you mean?
 ... I wanted to vomit but I didn't have to.
No... I didn't feel any differently.
Look at you.
This is her problem.
Let her solve it.
Give her advice? Stop wasting our time. We need to get out of here.
Give her advice? Yes  No 
Is this how you wanted things to go down? I don't know if I can do this alone.
This is going to be fun.
Not constantly.
Ever try to tell her something?
Only to have it seem too real?
This is going to be fun.
Every time.
You got anything on you.
Do you want to texting Abigail or something?.
 anywhere!
Going to the toilet?
Yeah this is it.
Filled with everything from soap to water.
A nice day for a great day.
What did you need?
Nothing.
Just water and don't talk to me.
That's it?
No.
Well Lore it's time to leave.
I don't understand...
What?
You left us both a great day.
Maybe you're right...
Don't worry about it. We all make mistakes sometimes.
I still think a little revenge is a good thing.
Thanks.
No reason to celebrate.
I know how hard things can be sometimes.
Just give it a shot?.
Yep yep ya.
Any surprises for you...?
Nothing... Nothing...
You almost made it!
Sorry... I didn't mean to.
You almost made it!
Sorry... I didn't make...
That's fine...d make it!
That's what I do, girl.
Sometimes the only way you can help others is if and when you fight back.
That's what matters most, kiddo.
Give her the lift! She or he will get the point.
That's what matters, kiddo.
You did it!
Yeah you did.
