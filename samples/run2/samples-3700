.
I was thinking... Yeah, maybe you're right.
True.
Yet you're still hesitant.
True?
True isn't a choice.
Choice is a tough one.
You're right. It is.
Yet you feel hesitant at times.
Sigh.
That's okay.
It's not even my fault.
You're right. I was trying to help.
It was my fault.
I'LL MAKE SURE OF IT!!!
Why do you feel the need to hide from home?
I'm sorry to say that isn't always the best idea.
The one time you needed help.
Well, I guess?
What did you need?
That coffee.
That sandwich.
It's too disappointing.
It's too disappointing.
Why did you come here?
Why did you come here?
I came to help.
I just need this to get her over the edge.
Is this it? I don't know what life is like.
It's not even me...
You know what... I'm glad you asked.
No reason to come here.
What do you think this place is?
Looks like West End SPCA is closed. That's good at least.
Hey BUDderwell!
Hey you again!
You again!
I'm Erin Brock I.D. You make a great punny host.
Hey you again!
You again!
You again!
You make a fun game of jokes.
Fair point! I'm the funny kid for pizzas.
Well yeah, I make fun of you.
Pizza nerd.
And now for tech.
Well yeah, that's not very funny.
Hrm...
So... the guy with the bagpipes job is moving in?
Yes.
Alright, that's not very funny.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Go play with your food.
Alright, someone's breaking into the local pawn shop. They've've been fired.
This is your chance. You're hereby terminated.
Well, that's not very funny.
Hrm...
So... The Beaver is down?
Turn him up!
He's not going to turn me down!
<|endoftext|>Hey Newhire!
I know you're in these situations, Worker.
But I don't see much of it. Thanks for your hard work.
Hey worker, you got my full tax payer pension. Back it on your way back.
I'm OScar. I can't even move my feet.
MEOW!
You can't be serious.
Expecting my problem... I actually fixed it.
Wait... there it is?
Well I mean... there's not a lot of rolls with these big of you.
You're kidding... You're actually taking good care of me.
Anyway... this brings me to you...
Wait... I...
FUZZY PICTURE OF EGG SAD?!
It's too late for me... I need to get home.
Oh hey you haven't worked in IT yet! I'm sorry... You usually weren't wrong.
First pickle the... THE PICKLE?!
That's it...nip it in the bud?
That's it...
Second pickle the... THE PICKLE?!
That's it...
Take the pick?
I SERIOUSLY can't be a pickle fan!
What did you just pick my friend?
Wait... really?
Well don't worry about it.
You're fine... Just... play with your food."
That's it...
That's it...
That's it...
That's it...
That's it...
<|endoftext|>Hey Newhire!
I know you're in these situations, but I just want to say that I'm OScar.
Hey worker, you got my full tax payer sa...
Hey newhire, you got my full tax payer fur.
Today was your chance to show us what it's like to make money.
It's time to get out of here.
You're getting your claws out?
Yep. I'm GIRL!
This is my first contribution to work in person.
Hello again, newhire!
Sorry for the trouble...
You can always just call to report...
Hey, what's the worst thing I've seen here?
Don't worry about it. It's life.
Ugh... what did I just say?


Don't worry about it.
I've never seen you before.
I'm sure you know what you're doing.
What do you mean?
I helped them get up.
That's firm...
Well that's it...
Here they are. Don't worry about them.
