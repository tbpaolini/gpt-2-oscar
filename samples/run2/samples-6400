Sorry if he got that far.
Well... whatever.
He's just been kind...
To be honest with thinker, I've not been as good as him.
Do you think he's been kind?
He's doing his best but you're not always your best.
You're right. I'm best, but you're probably not.
Hey, think!
You really think so?
I wouldn't be around if I wasn't working on myself.
I should probably be doing what you do best: helping others.
I should probably be doing what you do best: helping others. I should be focusing my energy on what was important to me instead of just focusing on himself.
That's kind of how it was at first...
Though...
It's not the best either.
What's the point?
Why'd you do that?

Looks like the power is still on.
It's just a printer...

Speaking of which...

The thing is he's been injured...

Yeah but he's not hurt...
he's in good condition.
Sorry...
He's too busy running for his life.
Anyway... CATCH IT! CATCH THE MONSTER!
What...?
Do you seriously think I'm done?
Then you have no business in the game.
I'm not a game developer.
You...
I'm a human chain gangster.

I've still got my mind.
He earned it.
Think nothing of it.
You're wasting time.
