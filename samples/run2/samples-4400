, I mean...
Yes.
So there's that.
Oh and did you know...?
We all did...?
Yes!
So now we just...
Weya!
Maybe a little...
Good.
You're supposed to be famous.
You're supposed to be famous.
That's who I am.
I am.
You're supposed to be famous.
You're supposed to be famous.
That's who I am.
You're right.
I am?
Yeah...
And I'm doing it right?
Well let's do it.
We will.
But first, I want to make you feel welcome.
I know you're not supposed to feel welcome.
I know you're not supposed to like me.
Well...
I don't know what you thought...
That's not very nice...
Don't worry about it.
I'm glad.
I'm here to see if you want something.
What...?
I don't know what you wanted...
Just something that time was up.
Don't worry about it.
What is this?
This is my...
It's not even strawberry.
It's too wet to be...
You know what...? Fine.
It tastes like sawdust and sadness...
It's too sweet to be...
It's too... wrong.
I think.
BUT!
It will be fine.
So maybe this is why...?
Yeah...
I'm not sure if that's...
How would you describe it?
SOMEME CAP
ON FOR SALE!!!
NO MERCH ANGE!!!
NO CLUE AT ALL!!!
I saw a hair on...
That's not real...
You didn't see anything?
I... uhh...
I'm pretty sure.
So... what's the catch?
Just a favor. Something harmless.
Sound good?
Not like I have a choice...
That's the spirit.
Check the whiteboard for a password. You'll need it for work.
Oh yeah, one more thing.
Don't do anything my buddy Whistler here wouldn't like.
He can get pretty... direct... if you know what I mean.
Pleasure to meet you. I look forward to working with you.
Seeya round, Intern.

Duck...
Why are you here?
I... Why should I be here?
You're dead anyway.
Uhh...
Oh hey, you like that.
That's kind of messed up about death.
Yeah...
Don't worry about it. There are still parts where you can be right.
Just... dont tell anyone you're in their place.
Don't tell them you love them.
Don't tell them what you think of them.
That's it?
That's it.
Okay. Let's go then.
Why are you here?
I heard about Joe getting a mammogram.
That's pretty rad.
You probably know what I'm here for.
If you know anything about Joe's habits you can definitely contact me.
Seriously?
No...?
Come around the corner.
I won't let you do that.
Why?
Because I'm only going to let you do that.
Wait... Why do you want to do that?
Why do you want to hurt Joe?
I can stop you.
Yes.
I do?
Then you should be ok.
I'm not denying that.
Well... yeah I am.
Right?
Yeah...
I'm glad.
So what did you have in mind?
Uhh...?
For... porn?
What?
I wanted to know what your baby was like.
I don't... know what he or she is?
That's a FACT!
WHAT A FACT!
OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH
So... I guess... You get the idea.
Yeah well, that was kind of scary.
Still not enough?
