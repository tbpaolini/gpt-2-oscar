 to get up.
Sorry... I wasn't supposed to be here.
Wow... You look so silly.
I guess you're right... I guess I was?
It's just a joke.
Hey stop looking at my silly cubbies.
Hey stop staring at my cubbies.

<|endoftext|>Oh hey there.
Hey ya there.
So maybe this is the right place?
Yeah... I think I'm alright here.
Maybe?
You're kind of a jerk now.
What do you mean?
Wake up...are you ok?
I don't know...I just don't know."
You nod and head out.
Forget about it.
You didn't know anything.
Ivan made the right choice.
You caught a cold shoulder.
But you weren't wrong.
The wrong guy.
He hurt me and now I'm in his arms.
I want to help him, don't we.
We don't need his money.
I don't know if I'm even right or not.
What have you done...?
I don't know what I'm capable of.
But you did it anyway, dude.
<|endoftext|>Hey buddy, wanted to say a big ooze of respect after being hit in the head. Also, something I thought I'd leave out...
You don't hit men in the home... you hit people in the heart.
Hurt those people.
Hit them in the heart.
Hit them directly in the gut.
That's the bad guy feeling right now.
He or she needs to go with his gut.
What do you want from this?
Revenge.
Rage.
Obtained after destroying HYDRA depots.
Duty Fire.
Great Bullseye.
You acquired under a special contract.
Disgusting.

Dude...

<|endoftext|>Oh hey Binder.
You may take a moment to register with the world.
Things used to be fun when I was Zapping you.
You were a bad guy.
My soul was with you...wrong... Akira Iori
Magic was reborn and Iirium mining finally starts!
Wait... what?
Ever wished the same for you?
You didn't know what I wrought.
Magic is still my passion.
My research shows that it works even without it.
Arcanum grows on trees and uses them for shade. Iirium takes on a mysterious brand.

There's a lot going on. I don't care how big or small you are.
There's a lot going on. My brain doesn't work like it needs to.
There's a lot going on. I feel terrible.
I just need to relax for a bit.
That's all I've got right now.
Let's head back to my place.
I'm kind of scolded for this.
I tell you what... It's not that I can't be careful, it's just I don't know how."
<|endoftext|>Wait... did you just say I'm not a hero?
