======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 to the right place at the right time.
At the same time, the game is really quick in that regard.
The problem is that it takes a lot to learn how to play fast and easy.
The only problem is, it's hard enough that you get used to it.
Wait... I mean, what do you mean...?
You know what? You should be. Right?
Oh... I'm sorry...
It's nothing...
You can just get used to this kind of thing.
It's just not my cup of tea.
Maybe I should just give it one last try?
I...
Of course!
Let's go, kid!
I'm finished...
See you later, kid.
Yeah, I got my ducks under control.
I guess?
Yeah... I'll try to be as fast as I can before things get any worse.
Then I do my best...
<|endoftext|>Yeah, you got that.
I mean... the game is kind of quick.
You didn't do anything...
Nah, there were a lot of things I worked on.
<|endoftext|>Really?
Yeah, I thought you said you'd play a little longer before taking anything real bad.
I'm just gonna save that for later.
Then I'll be done here and now.
Nice.
It looks like you've gotten a little spooked.
That didn't feel right.
Well then...
Go get the heck out of here.
Alright, well... yeah, but I have little control over things. Let's just do this.
Yeah... I guess...
Alright... Let's see how things go then...
Alright, fine.
Well, I did my best.
It's just... really hard.
I think this is gonna be fun.
<|endoftext|>Nah, it didn't feel that bad.
Anyway...
Thanks.
That was fun...
Really?
Yeah, it was.
Not really.
Well... I guess...
Yeah...
No problem.
You sure about that?
That's pretty good.
I...
That's alright.
Alright...
I got this.
It's just... I can't do this alone...
Ohhh...
<|endoftext|>Well...
You're glad to see me.
Good.
I am...?
You're always glad.
Yeah...
Yeah...
That's kinda messed up.
It's always messed up.
Then again...
I'm glad...
Yeah...
Well... I'm glad...
You weren't sure what to do.
You...
Never felt this good before.
<|endoftext|>That's enough.
Alright...
It's just that you need me to fix this.
Don't worry about the money.
Don't worry about your life here.
Don't worry about what we have.
It's alright if you're too busy.
Alright...
It's not alright if I'm not around...
So... what do you need then?
How do you want it?
What do you need?
I don't know how you can ask me this kind of stuff, kid.
It's a tough job, kid.
Just remember to take the time to enjoy yourself.
You're doing the whole journey, kid.
So what exactly are you looking forward to?
I'm not sure what I want...
Just... want to do this.
That's it, kid.
Well... what do you need...?
Everything?
You gotta start thinking and doing this right then.
It's not going to be easy.
Oh...
I'm sorry, dude.
I...
I just don't know how.
Everything feels a little overwhelming at the same time.
Hey... uhh... I'm alright, dude?
No worries. Just try not to think hard.
Well... maybe.
Don't worry about me.
No worries. Just try not to think about me.
I think we should talk about this later, kid.
How do you feel?
What...?
Just a little.
I don't really feel good right now.
It's kind of late for a party, dude.
You know... kind of late really...
I'm afraid you just don't feel that way...
I...
I mean, I think we could talk a little bit, dude.
I hope so, dude.
What is it like being... a real guy?
You know? I'm not that guy.
But it's not the first time or anything like that. I mean... you're pretty good at it sometimes, dude.
Hurt me if I'm wrong...
Yeah... not at all
