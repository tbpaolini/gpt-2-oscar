======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 next to get some rest!
Sleep on the job? No Yes
<|endoftext|>A calming autumn world. A soft wind blows through the trees.
It feels like Animus... but the trees are off like that.
A sweetling with long, spiky ears and nice, smarmy blue eyes.
It's formality. We slum like this in the woods.
This place is truly terrifying. Make it stop...
Every step is a step away. Slave 1 has already been designated a Space Marine.
This cubicle is the only one of its kind! Prepare to crush the fist of any worker!
This cubicle is the only one of its kind! Prepare for mistakes. There's only one Miracle Worker in this whole place!
This machine is so powerful it can turn any worker into a ghost.
This is it. Worker A is now a Space Marine. Worker B now a Lore Lynx.
All you really got was one last chance. Worker A will now be a ghost!
Wait... did you just... kill someone already? No Yes
Try to kill someone else? No Yes
<|endoftext|>It's a bunch of brightly colored ants. The colors vary a lot.
These red candies are just likeRIHO MANSIX.
These red candies are just likeRIHO MANSIX MORE!!!
These red candies are just likeWHATEVER YOU are!
These are just... jars. There's a little jar in here.
That's not a toy farm word processor!
This thing is real!
You're looking at a BLOOD FESTIVAL!
The camera is off and nothing is happening on the screen.
A bunch of tiny memories slumber in here.
A bunch of nasty memories litter the bottom of this barrel.
It's a nightmare of your own making.
The barrel lays motionless in the dark.
A bunch of weird looking memories are woken up in here.
A few memories of being in the woods or something.
A bunch of wobbly memories kept here for reasons that remain under control.
It's a nightmare of your own making.
<|endoftext|>Bedrock!
Bedrock is here! He must be brought to account for this.
How long has it been like this?
It's been rough on the people.
My men. They're up to no good.
My people. Up to no bad.
All this talk seems to have stopped me from even moving.
I can do this. I can do this.
This is the start of every bad memory.
Nothing I do will fix anything.
I've never felt so motivated.
You're basically making this up?
No way! It's all going to ok!
I know you're right...
It's nothing every theist is a thing.
Just one more obstacle on the path to depression.
No... I'm not going to lie...
Don't worry about it. Embrace it!
<|endoftext|>What I want but not what I need.
Will this even make a difference? No Yes
Ready as I can be.
Awash in the endless grey.
Feels familiar but something's wrong.
I jerked my shoulder.
I can't change this.
What are you talking about? I don't have any assets left.
Maybe I just want to go home.
What...?
Wake up get some rest.
I don't know what you want...
You want to go home? Yeah, right.
That sounds good.
What does home look like?
It's going to be lonely.
Sooner as you leave.
You're going to be lonely.
Sooner then you'll know.
JUST CLOSE...
Like a heavy object blocks your path.
A soft stone lining your back.
<|endoftext|>prison what?
Let me be the judge?
How about this?
Just say yes?
I sugget you.
Judge over me?
Yes.
You must make me happy.
That will not be easy then.
So... what are we going to do with it?
We will be ZOMBIES...
WHORES...
BEASINGS...
ROBES...
YOU ALL GAME CAVEAT I FINE!!!
Well... what's the catch?
You say.
Take the block? No Description mine Is this it? This is it. This is it.
You just... you just...
Oh... I don't know what I'm doing.
Thanks...
You paid for it.
Go on... Transport this to your next plan point.
No more problems here.
No less of a challenge there.
There...
