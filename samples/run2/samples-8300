======== SAMPLE 1 ========

My name is Terry. You're kind of a jerk.
Terry is dead.
You know what you did.
That's even more reason for celebration than any other word.
What are you talking about?
Back before he pushed you out.
This isn't right... It's not real...
You're faster than you look!
I... what...?
Are you alright?
Yeah, sorry... Just kinda phased out for a minute there.
Don't worry about it. We all deal with things in our own ways.
So... what are we doing out here?
Hunting.
Hunting for what exactly?
For a very rare and... tasty looking creature.
You don't say...
I do say.
In fact... I'm looking at it...
right...
NOW!!!
ENRAGED CLUCKING
WHARRGARBL!!!
There it is...
Wait... what?
Grab the food pods... Before it escapes...
Food pods?
RUN, YOU FOOL!!!
It's been busy.
You again...
This one knows us, dear brother.
It may not wish to, dear sister.
Well, you're right about that.
How unfortunate for it.
We shall see.
In time.
I don't need your pity.
Hello again, little one.
You again...
It recognizes us, dear sister.
It matters not, dear brother.
You don't get to choose what matters.
It's helping.
We shall see.
In time.
I don't need your pity.
It's fighting.
We shall see.
In time.
I don't need your pity.
It's slain.
Yet none of this does anything.
It may yet wish to help.
We shall see.
That's enough.
Enough?
Definitely not.
It wanted more.
It dug into her life.
It gained nothing and helped no one.
That is not for us to decide, dear sister.
Perhaps, dear brother.
Enough?
It lied to her.
It concealed information.
This benefits no one.
It may yet wish to help.
We shall see.
We shall.
There is not enough of this.
It may yet wish to help.
We shall see.
We shall.
There is not enough of this.
It may yet choose to help.
We shall see.
We shall.
There is not enough of this.
It may yet choose to help.
We shall see.
We shall.
There is not enough of this.
It may yet choose to help.
We shall see.
We shall.
There is not enough of this.
It may yet choose to help.
We shall see.
There is not enough of this.
It may yet choose to help.
It was left wanting.
Justine was left wanting.
It's you, dear brother.
It's you, dear sister.
It's you, dear sister.
It was left wanting.
It has no values.

Enough of this.
It may yet wish to help.

This is strictly a Time Tower.
No animal or man can move this far.
It is covered in secrets.
You don't know what they are...
Nothing to read on the page.
A cool wind blows through the glass.
A pile of papers.
Fourteen marks are printed out.
Took you to read one of them.
Sorry, Rat. I'll need to get back to you.
Alright, what do you need?
You found a sock reading a book.
What was that?
Tagged the same book as the sock.
Something painful.
You can't run this time.
It's tower-bound.
It's stormy outside.
It's towerbound.
It's stormy outside.
You barely knew what you were getting yourself into.
You seem kinda down.
Time to clean up this mess.
My apologies, Rat. I'm sorry, I don't really know what I'm doing.
Thanks for the life lesson, dude.
