 is about time.
Why would you give me that kind of time?
Why would you give me money?
It's about time I talked to you.
You're wasting my time.
I'm not your problem.
You're being petty.
I'm your problem.
Why do you need to know my money?
Why do you need to know my life?
Why do you need to see me?
<|endoftext|>Wait...
Why did you have to go through that?
I didn't have to.
That's my money!
ENTER HALLWAY, RINGIN IS DEADARMED!
Oh hey, you found Lore!
Hey... she's pretty.
I saw her in person.
Can you believe you?
You can't.
So... what are you doing here?
Is it over? Iain Don't you know me?
I'm Reus. You should know that.
What is?
What is?
I'm in favor.
So are you.
Of course.
So are you... Reus is my enemy.
Well, don't worry about it.
Is this it? Not my fault, dude. I didn't expect this from you.
Everything will be ok. Let's go get lunch.
I love you.
Alright, favorite spot in town. You must still get caught up in the '90s.
Last shot of water tower. Looks like Rhode is going to like it.
Lost and Found. Business As Usied.
Rhode...?
Help!
Not our Lost and Found, but your fault!
What are you talking about...? Tower Corp workers' shirts.
Dang, that's pretty rad.
Flowers. Seriously.
That's pretty rad.
Oh yeah?
Yeah.
Are you saying we don't deserve flowers?
Nope.
So... what are you doing here?
This isn't our fault.
Come on, rad.
Come on...
You're a criminal.
You're a criminal.
Who created you?
I sent you here to take down the corporate world leader.
You think I'm cool?
Lore makes for an awesome twin sister video.
<|endoftext|>The door is gone.
Shrinking...and getting stronger.
That's life...
You're falling down...trying to push yourself away...
You're almost up from under you.
Just keep moving... you'll get over this.
You're barely able to move your head from when you saw him.
It's completely silent...
What did you just just do to me?
It still doesn't move.
Something fishy.
Yeah...
You just shot yourself in the fucking head.
What...?
You didn't even hit him...
You just sent the ship flying.
You lost...lose on strategy.
Fern.t.t me.
You know what?
Yeah... I know...
You should pay more attention to surroundings.
Instagram.
Your phone is on the other side of the bed.
It's full of... emails.
Not the proper...
the correct...

8. Disgusting
There are hundreds of emails in here.
One is from someone you don't even know.
It's a pretty pretty email.
It's from Interns.
You know what they're up to? Work.
It's only going to get better.
There's a bunch of Business people working together to improve the environment.
Hey, uh...
That's not what I saw.
That's not what I should have seen.
It's a pretty pretty pretty email.
It's from Supplies.
They just sent me this text while I was down.
"...and everything...uh...
Yeah and it's a pretty pretty bunch of workers... Why would you give this company anything else than their labor?
This displays weakness. We will win if we take this easy.
This displays compassion. We will win if we take this easy.
This displays conviction. We will win if we take this easy.
They just sent me this text while I was down.
"...and everything...uh...
What could have made this say these words?...
A sick joke. What could have turned out this way.
It's a sad text. Patience is probably a pretty big fee.
That chip in the side is quiet.hard.
True crime? Yes True Crime? Pathetic trash.
You're definitely not a journalist.
I'm your trash! I know it!
You're definitely not a journalist. You're calm now.
I'm your trash! I know it!
You're still not a zombie.
Yes, I am!
Yeah,
