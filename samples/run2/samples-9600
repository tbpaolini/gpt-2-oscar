The receiver clicks as you pick it up.
Hello son, it's your dad.
We're in Early Access so I don't have much time right now.

The receiver clicks again as it cuts out.

<|endoftext|>Going back to bed seems like a bad idea.
There we go, all set to battle the day.
No need to get dressed a second time.
Boof... Boof...
He's out like a light.
Yikes! Lore?! Are you ok buddy?
I think so... The lightswitch is toast though.
I'm going to head back to bed. This day is already sour enough.
Wait... What about breakfast?
Dude... it's too early for food.
It's never too early for food! Where is your sense of adventure?
Sleeping, like we should be.
You know I can't open the can...
Oh fine... let's get going then. Your fault if anything else goes wrong.
Baron isn't even awake yet.
Might want to grab your sweater before we go. It should be in your dresser.
You really can't be thinking about going in your pajamas, can you?
Not my monkey, not my circus. Whatever you want to do I got your back.
The storm outside is getting rough.
Go back to sleep? Yes No
Already fast asleep.
There's a huge slash across the back...
It's too stormy to see anything...
<|endoftext|>Hey buddy.
I know things can get tough sometimes.
Just don't forget to have fun, even if it all looks grim.
Follow your heart and don't give up on anything or anyone.
I will always be with you, right by your side.
We got this.
Don't worry about today. A little bump in the road is not a big deal.
<|endoftext|>Damn, he must be up.
That's ok, maybe he's in a good mood today?
Hey kiddo, the kitchen trash is overflowing. Go take it out would you?
Hey moron, the kitchen trash is overflowing. Go take it out. 
Problem solved! That wasn't so bad right?
Always the optimist... At least it's just the trash.
Definitely don't want
