...
The thought of it...
It's over soon.
Not my fault youbro.
You dur little things right.
You stole that thingy in a litter.
Lust is rewarded when it costs money.
When it fills you again it makes no difference.
No problem.
Every once in a while you get a bit of time to yourself.
Maybe someone to share it with and think things over.
Then before you know it...
BAM!!!
You're back out in the woods on your own again.
I don't know...
Does it have to be that way?
Well... not always.
It's actually kind of funny.
What is?
Not sure if you noticed but...
A certain tall drink of nervous wreck might have eyes for me.
Stay out of it.
This isn't our problem.
Did you notice? Pry a bit. I didn't notice anything.
Did you notice? What cougar? Nope.
Maybe a little...?
Maybe a little?
Disgusting.
You'll never learn.
I knew I was onto something!
So what do you think I should do...?
What should Fern do? Follow your heart. Better just play it safe.
You really think so?
Why not take the chance?
What if you're wrong?
What if I'm right?
Why should I listen to you? Your hoof-eye coordination is terrible!
Well I mean... You did just ask me.
True...
Seems pretty risky.
Is it really worth the risk?
Addendum. Fern has massively outgrown this enclosure and is thriving. New employees are phased out in large part due to poor productivity. Fern is now exhibiting elevated levels of anxiety and fear. Fern is exhibiting elevated levels of anxiety and fear.
Well... I guess I'm ready for what comes next?
Uhh... what should I be doing?
I should start over.
Y... yes.
YAY FORGE!!!
W... X...
ARGH!!!
So... you're doing... EITHER?
Definitely.
I don't know what I was thinking...
Oh no...
You're going to have to give up.
So what do you want?
Eggbed ready for egg hunt.
Lactation animals on the go. No egg jobs for them.
No more eggbound workers for the boss.
There's gonna be a point when you're done and I need a new one...
What point is that?
Don't worry about it. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes.
Don't worry about it.
I guess you're right... Why not take the chance?
Wouldn't it be boring if you didn't?
You would get the point.
What if I didn't want to random?
That's what life is like.
Would you listen to me.
Presumably.
No.
Well then... here we go.
Is this how you wanted things to go down?
Is this what you wanted? I want to fix this. You deserve this.
Wait... really?
Yeah... this isn't right...
Well if that's what you're going to do then I know you can do it.
Hey... pretty sure it's too late for me.
But there will be others...
Help them...
Turn this whole thing around.
Good luck out there.
You know...
Never thought I'd say this but...
I'm glad.
I wouldn't want to spend my life...
Knowing someone like you was out there anyway.
Imagine where things would be...
If you had only stopped at one.
<|endoftext|>He hurt you again.
Hurt him back.
How do you feel? He didn't mean to. Hurt him.
You don't know what you're talking about.
I do.
You just can't see it yet.
Maybe you're right...
You'll get your chance.
Keep going.
<|endoftext|>Squire...
...?
We have many paths in life.
The ones we choose aren't always the best.
But... they're ours.
They define us.
They make us who we are.
Do you know who you are? No Yes
That's not a bad thing.
What do you mean?
Life is a journey of discovery.
We don't have to skip to the end to enjoy it.
I don't understand...
It's alright if you don't right now.
You will in time.
We all do eventually.
I see...
There's still time to change.
Things don't have to be this way.
Do you want things to be this way? I can fix this. This is how it should be. This
