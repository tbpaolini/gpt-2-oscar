======== SAMPLE 1 ========
!
Well, sorry... It's time for the kid.
I thought you ran!
Nothing to be done!
We're blocked out?
See where this goes?!
What do you mean?
Took all of you like... myself... down.
What are you doing here?
Why do you have all of this down?
It's no big of a surprise then... I got this.
What...?
I said get us some water.
Let's get you started on our adventure.

Let's get you started on our adventure. Short: OScar
Long: Big: This monster is intense.
Little: What...?
You just... you didn't do anything.
That's pretty messed up.
That's pretty messed up. You lied.
That's pretty messed up.
That's pretty messed up.
All of this...
It's just a lot.
It's beautiful.
Lots of little things.
You'll always be tiny.
You'll always be beautiful.
What a beautiful face.
A pretty face.
You'll always be pretty.
How do you feel...?
It's on the way to paradise.
What...?
It's not real.
It's too late for anything now.
It's too late for anything at all.
What...?
It's surrounded.
There's a huge slash across the back...
It's a hat.
Maybe I'm a Haiku Guy...
My real one is waiting for me right here...
Who... what is this?
You're actually kind of a...
It's too late for anything.
It's too late for anything.
That's all it is, really.
Hrm...
That's pretty messed up.
That's pretty messed up. You actually put so much effort into getting this done.
I'm glad you sense this.
I'm glad you do.
Yeah, sure.
Couldn't be... right?
You almost made it!
I... I don't know how...
All that thinking made sense.
It's not my fault.
It's just going somewhere else.
No...
I'm not going to help anyone anymore.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
I never intended on helping anyone.
I'm sorry too...
That's not very nice...
Just think about all the garbage you could have done instead.
Why did you do that?
Why did you hurt anyone?
Why is that still a big word?
I forgive you... You're still a little sorry.
I didn't mean to...
I should have listened to you.
It's alright if you don't right now.
I'm sorry...
It's your turn.
Did you really just... pass?
No...
 just pass?
I don't know what I was thinking...
What are you thinking...?
Why would you pass?
Why would you pass? You're already out of my way...
I don't know what I was thinking...
Just pass. Don't worry about the pass.
What...?
That's it... Just pass.
You're already out of my way...
I don't know what I was thinking...
What...?
Leave that for me.
It's super obvious what you're doing.
How do you know?
I walked into a door that would open.
What...?
Just a door.
Oh... Sorry... I didn't mean to...
Don't worry about it.
Just leave me alone already.
Uhh... really?
I'm not sure if that's... sick or... sick.
You really didn't stand a chance.
Just leave me alone already.
Uhh... really?
I really... don't know what to say.
Well, kinda... just went for it.
Yeah... slowed a bit so you could get under the desk.
I... what...?
You did just ask right?
Yeah... sorry...
Don't worry about it.
I'm sorry...
Hey, did you just say you didn't have a choice?
I mean... sure...
I wouldn't want to spend my life in the dark.
Just leave me alone already.
Uhh... really?
Hey, just leave me alone already.
Yeah...
Good.
So, you want to go for it?
Yeah... just like you wanted to go for it.
What...?
You want to go for it?
Well... yeah.
It's a bunch of little frogs. You jerk a lot.
Hey, that's pretty messed up huh?
Yeah... I guess?
For crying out loud.
What...?
This isn't real.
You passed out from some unknown agent.
Oh... Sorry.
Don't worry about it.
