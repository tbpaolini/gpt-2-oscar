 my chest. She must be close by...
It's just a memory of something that happened a minute ago.
<|endoftext|>My best friend is a working stapler. They're hard at work on their shifts.
The only thing I have is my GamerStaplerStapler and I're StaplerStapler.
Foolish greed.
Supercilious greed.
A waste...
A waste...
A waste...
A special gifts container for gaming.
Mystery sock... What would happen if I did?
A random sticky note...
Fern staple... What if I ate it?
A random sticky note...
A random sticky note...
Fern staple... What if I ate it?
Nope!
<|endoftext|>Your path seems to have led to nowhere.
Perhaps I've missed a pathway.
A calm autumn world. The wind is chill...
You twitch your bottom fits the bill.
A booming clang is heard.
This old anvil has a smudged out name on the side. Something that starts with A and ends with E.
This must have taken hundreds of blows from Emelio's hammer. It's still in pretty good shape!
A lump of cold metal blocks your path.
You make your way slowly.
Sleeping, hobbled, and unused to motion.
You're starting to understand.
A strange research paper. Strange symbols on them.
It's full of pocket protectors. What a strange friendship!
You only get that wish sometimes.
You lost your balance on the deck. Hilarious stuff with the fasteners on the side.
You can't change the subject.
Not yet enough.
You're still got room here.
An old dark carrot lays in a terrarium. The vines have taken their place.
Hey, you made it!
Yeah, sorry...
The key is in a tiny bowl. I forgot how handy this is.
A small exquisite stone figurine sits solemnly in a glass display nestled between the books.
Hey, do you need anything?
I just need this moment.
The figurine slowly nods its head in agreement.
Well, I'm a cactus and my stomach level is now at 300 calories.
Well, that's just fine.
You're a cactus. What're you doing here?
No, I'm more interested in looking at these things than eating!
What if I'm eating nothing?
Wait... what?
Fern seeds?
Are you eating anything?
No...
The strange potion replenishes the fancy cacti.
Hey, what's this for?
You asked me and I pretty much gave you what you deserved!
Well... I'm honored.
You can do this.
Have a good day.
Yeah _________|
Duck.
Duck.
Duck.
Duck.
Duck.
You found a hard working sock! Business!
Sealed closed with tons of sticky notes.
A bunch of papers with poorly drawn ducks on them.
There are like... 50 pens in here.
This computer is ridiculous. You can't even see the screen.
Welp, got one.
Don't need another one of these things.
Definitely not doing that again.
It's just a bunch of garbage data.
Blinking lights in a field of darkness.
Wow, that was embarassing.
Oh boy, really messed that one up huh?
Just uhh... Do your best.
Don't give up.
I really can't do this...
You're totally right about that.
Just... do your best.
Thanks.
Well... Don't give up.
I don't know what you expected.
You really can't be this good.
Sorry...
I'll be better.
I don't know what I expected.
You really can't hit that level of concentration on a given row.
Not my fault you're a basket head.
You're a basket head. You really can't hit that though.
Except... it's not really a basket head.
So... what now?
Well, it's a nice day... Wanna hang out for a bit?
You're wasting time.
She doesn't care about you.
Hang out with Rhode? Yes No
Disgusting.
You'll never learn.
You're just a pawn.
They aren't real.
Ahh... Well, that's cool too.
See you around... I guess...
Wait... REALLY?!
Yeah, why not?
I just thought you wouldn't want to stick around.
I mean... I was kind of a jerk a minute ago...
Don't worry about it. Everyone makes mistakes
