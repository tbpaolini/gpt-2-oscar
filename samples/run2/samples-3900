======== SAMPLE 1 ========
It was super hot out here...
I put a... towel to my wetness...?
I feel bad about breaking the bed...
Yeah, but I'm only going to help myself if you...
I'm not going to help yourself.
Well, you're right about me.
Yeah, but I'm not very good at hiding.
I just need to know that before you try to grab me.
Alright... I don't mind you.
What do you think myyec do?
Research.
Find what do?
Find the coffee mug.
You make a great host if you need a bit of time.
Sit down.
Hang in there!
(Cut to... A bunch of people talking)
A WHOLE SLED OF WATCHERS!
Yeah! They're all wrong.
Yeah...
Try to figure it out.
This place is too big to be a nightmare.
TSI: I know, you're right.
Yeah... It's not my fault.
Well... you should stop... already.
I... what?
You...
I hate to say it but...
It's for the best.
I'm not mad at you for that.
I'm for it.
I said pay for the future.
A higher value proposition.
A sock for the future?
No problem.
All jokes aside, is everything alright?
Yeah... I just know that from now on.
No...
You're right.
I'm glad you asked.
It's alright to do nothing every now and then.
Just do your best?
That's what family is for.
Hey... you're at the pool.
Yeah, but I'm not a dad.
I wonder what Home Alone looks like?
Let's get you some hot chocolate!
That's it!

The couch!
The one we all hang out with all alone in our favorite part of town.
It's too nice to leave.
So, we're going to Central.
It's just taking our bike?
It's all ours.
Oh...
We should definitely get going.
Yeah, sure.
Going to the woods?
Going to the woods is pretty easy.
Getting to the bottom of it all.
So... what's on the other side?
A bass guitar and some drums.
What is?
A bass player.
Hey kid, want a buddy? I can help.
Sure thing! You can join the fun at the nearby apple.
Sure thing! You can't!
Hey, welcome to the woods.
What do you have on?
A beautiful autumn stick.
You know what? Fine.
Dog.
If you want it back.
I can handle it. It's too dangerous now.
Either way, I'm off to the unknown.
Declining hormones.
It's full of sweetener cubs are getting.
What a sweet.
Well, it's not even strawberry.
What...?
Welp... Kind of... baby.
You're kind of getting tired of this.

This thing isn't here.
Huh... I caught it.
I...? Get rid of this thing.
I. Am not conducting nor backing this place.
Why would I want to spend my time like this?
Well yeah, that's for the best. But I'm not stopping you.
Yeah but, this is kinda tough.
Yeah but, this is really lame.
You
