======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 with the other team. They are all completely unmoving.
This is a pretty decent job of keeping the other team abreast of everyone's progress.
It's a bit disappointing that the others just finished. Maybe it's that?
Don't look back.
Now then, everyone!
We are the Blood Angels. You are an All-Father who has been corrupted by madness.
Is this what you wished for?
What kind of monster makes you so obsessed with perfection?
No one can tell you this but me.
Uhh... I should get out of here before it started...
Don't worry about me. I'll be back shortly.
Just leave this field blank.
You can't do this.
Oh wow... You're kind of sarcastic...
You almost killed me...
I didn't...
I did...
Don't do this again...
You'll never find me...
Don't give up.
I knew you would...
Always...
I just wanted to help...
Yeah!
So... what now?
I know you're going to get me.
What?
I...
You sure...?
Yeah...
Come on then! It's time!
Are you ready? I want to play hide and seek with you.
No!
Just get in the way!
Alright, yeah and no. That's ok.
I'll let you know if you come with me.
Alright so you're not ready.
Well sure.
What about a minute?
Let's go get our weapons up and ready for battle.
Don't worry about me though. I can do that.
Alright...
You're almost there.
Seeya, kid.
Just want to be extra careful around the kids though.
Alright...
That's pretty risky stuff.
We can go fight each other again though.
Alright...
Yeah ok...
Alright, sure.
Don't worry about it. It won't hurt.
What...?
Just leave this field blank.
<|endoftext|>Is there a fight between us?
Who knows.
No...
Just what?
A few bad jokes and we can't hurt each other.
That's not real fight like that.
You know what? No more of that.
Fine. Let's go fight again.
You know what? Don't leave this field blank.
That's not real fight like that.
We'll need to go back and check this again.
Oh...
I'm out of batteries so this isn't a good idea.
Alright...
We can get back to it later.
Alright...
We only just...
A new start isn't a bad idea.
Don't give up.
You can't do this.
You did everything in your power to protect me.
You know what?
Nope.
You can't.
<|endoftext|>Alright, this is it.
You finished all of this.
I want to know more.
Is there anything I can do?
Tell you what...
This isn't over yet?!
I don't need his advice.
This isn't over yet?
Yes!
Wow...
You really got on your feet.
You can feel all of that in the air now.
You just always did that to yourself before...
Just... stop...
Try again?
Try again...
No...
Not again.
All this work to make you do what you wanted but now you're getting pretty beat up.
I can't do this.
I don't know how...
I can.
I will...
I will.
That's not enough...
The door's locked and we're on our own...
So we go find a fight then break into a bunch of good company and get some work done.
This isn't enough.
We can do this.
Don't do this.
This feels like too much...
We can do this...
We can do this...
All of this seems kind of... whacky right?
You know...
So... what do we do now?
I guess we got what you fell for here.
I guess we can go now?
I dunno.
I'm glad you came.
I guess the adventure starts here.
I think we should go huh?
Just kinda sit back... we'll see ya on the beach.
That's kind of hard... you're too busy doing your thing though to do anything silly like that.
Hey, ya know that?
Yeah...
The name's Spinner?
You know that?
Yeah?
We go to do the lame though sometimes.
You're kind of a whiny little jerk sometimes.
Well it's kinda fun.
There ya go, that's me.
