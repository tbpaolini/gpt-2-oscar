 back.
What...?
Just leave me alone!
You know... I didn't mean to...
Leave me feeling that way is completely harmless fun.
Not even the butterflies felt anything... serious.
And now... I know what you meant.
You're right... I'm not good at this kind of thing.
And now I'm dead.
So you're the bad guy.
What are you doing here?
You really are innocent still.
After all this you seem pretty hard on yourself.
I guess you're right... I'm sorry...
If I were you I wouldn't be doing this.
What...?
What do you mean?
You killed my best friend.
I know you are.
What...?
When you found out.
What did I do...?
How did that happen?
I didn't do anything...
I's Auronic...
What...?
When you found out.
Who sent you...?
Why?
Why now.
Why did you even send someone...?
Mom? Daddy? Why?
Who...
Where is Binder...?
Where is Binder...?
Where is she?
Is he still alive?
I can't say that yet.
What should I do? Follow your heart. Better just play.
What if you're gonna hurt me? No Yes
I don't know...
What should I do? You give up now and I'm done with this.
You're right... I should give up.
I'm sorry...
This is gonna be awkward...
Things can go wrong. Just don't give up.
I'mher/flier/whatever...
Just give.
A gasoline can is met with hesitation.
She is...
Wait...
Have you heard?
No...
She's not real.
Eugh.
You're getting stronger. You can't fight me...
What are you talking about?
Is this how you wanted it?
Is this what you wanted?
You really got this far?
Well I mean... this is going to be fun.
But seriously...
Thought it over.
Didn't happen.
No...
He got what he deserved.
But then I don't really know...
What if she isn't my best?
What if she isn't?
What if she isn't?
Not enough...
For now.
I'll let you know if she's ok.
Except...
For now.
I don't know if I'm even ready.
Or how I feel.
Not yet.
That's a good question.
So...
How do you feel?
I don't know...
Well what do you want?
When her...
Is everything alright?
I mean... yeah...
But then...how am I supposed to feel about you...?
You...
You shouldn't feel that way.
Not now... not next...
Not ever.
Not ever.
Not soon.
It's all over.
I've Endorsed her.
Uncle Binder is moving in my direction.
Yeah... Gus seems pretty comfortable around older ladies.
I haven't noticed and you wouldn't think it.
My name is Binder. You're right!
You're probably wondering how I got my start in the mud.
It's all my fault.
You're right. It's all my fault.
But I be careful...
Are you ready?
Sure...
What are you waiting for?
Obedient... but it comes at a high price.
Nothin' I could would avenge than you.
Yet you were unable to stop Binder.
I was right there to protect her.
But then...
Then we all are to Bulgari.
So... what do you think I can do?
What would that be like without you?
What do you think about civilians like you?
What do you think about civilians like you?
Are you ready?
Sure...
But then...
It's not always easy...
Don't worry about it.
I'm glad you asked that...
That's the spirit.
Thanks...
Just a favor and I expect a very... fast response.
Neat.
What's this one's for?
Something spicy.
Neat.
What...?
This is ridiculous.
This is... nothing...
STOP!!!
You're almost there just now.
It's buzzing now.
It's buzzing... For a moment.
Then it was dodging me.
Now it's reacting strangely.
This is its raison d'etres...
No...
It's not dead.
It's just a... thing.
Lightness...
Something moving in and out of it.
No...
It's not dead.
