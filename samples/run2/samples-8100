======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 to say anything is completely fine. My apologies for the trouble.
Alright, I'm fine. The library is out of batteries. What can I do?
Can't say that often enough.
It's open anyway.
What can I do?
Say what?
Say a word? Union Jack
Stand Back Seats Back
No Yes
No
No
Hey help me, Binder, I can't talk.
How do I keep my cool?
Step over here.
How do I keep my cool?
Look at me.
What do you want?
A cup of coffee.
She's gone because of you.
I just don't see the point.
Let's roll!
Yeah well, I'm down here. Talk about getting ready for the season.
Yeah well, I'm down here. Talk about getting ready for the season.
You really think you're not a threat?
I guess?
I guess?
You really think so?
I gotta get back to my place.
Huh... Got it?
Yep.
So... where are we going?
To the woods.
What...?
You'll see, silly.
What if I don't go?
Then you'll be missing out on a new experience.
Never thought about it that way.
Don't worry about it. Let's get going.
Yeah... Got it?
Let's go.
Yeah well, I'm down here.
I gotta get back to my place.
Huh...
Got it?
Yeah... Going back to the woods is like going home.
Couldn't be.
Then what is this?
This is gonna be ok.
I'm sorry, bud.
I don't know what to say...
I'll let you know if I have anything to say.
Sounds good.
We can go if you like...
Yeah bud.
The elevator is out to the north.
We should head northbound.
We're both on the north side of town.
You both know that.
Finally get to know one another.
We don't have to live this way.
It's alright if you don't.
There's still time for you to pick him up.
He's fine. Just...
Don't give up.
I've got everything.
What...?
No more hesitation.
No more hiding.
You can do this.
I've got everything.
No more hesitation.
A broken cycle.
Yet to come.
It's your choice.
We humans choose to let you choose.
You'll do what you want.
We're not fighting for your opinion.
I'm sure...
Good.
You're weaker than him.
He's still stronger than you.
You can beat him.
I chose this.
I think you're ready.
First step...
The elevator.
Here, hook the blinds together.
I'll let you finish this block.
Alright... I'll let you know when it's over.
That will not alter the fact that we share a dream.
<|endoftext|>We made this.
Trapped in this... nothing.
Lost and found... Nothing.
Unfortunate... We make do nothing of it.
We're both horrid cacti.
We just got here in the end.
You can't shame me for it.
Trapped in this... nothing. Lost and found... Nothing.
Just enough to get my tongue but not enough to kill me?
You can't really reach for it.
Why do you ask?
Because I'm trapped.
You're not telling the truth.
Why do you ask?
Because I'm torturing him.
You're not telling the truth.
Come on, Freak.
The dream is over.
I don't need your mercy.
No... I can't become his friend anymore.
I can't let you hurt me.
I got your back.
I'm not ready.
Get over here already.
Is this how you wanted things to go down?
This isn't what I wanted.
I asked for your help. I'm better.
You're not ready.
I don't know what you wanted here.
This is what you wanted.
What?
What did you just say to me?
What did you just say to me?
What?
I don't know...
I should stay here.
He's still out there, that type.
Hey, you alright?
OH! Sorry... I was just looking a bit too... grainy.
Yeah, sorry... Just kinda phased out for a minute.
Yeah, sorry...
Goodbye, Lore.
Goodbye, Joe.
No matter how busy we are, we get going.
