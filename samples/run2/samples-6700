======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 unmilled. Oof.
Well, OScar did say I'm a moron.
You mean... A bunch of sadists battle it out.
Me either way!
Well... Sorry... I didn't mean to invade your privacy.
Don't worry about it. I'll be setting the time!
Wait... what?
You brought along with you.
I don't know if I should be nervous.
Well... Sorry.
Don't worry about it.
I understand.
What?
Are you ready?
Have fun!
That's it...
Go play with your food.
I don't have any food.
What...?
Don't worry about it.
I don't know what you expected.
Hah...
Awkward...
You again...
This one knows us, dear brother.
It can't be real...
You're just playing with me.
I don't know what you expected.
Maybe I expected you to be a bit more sarcastic.
Less sarcastic than you expected.
I expected you to be serious.
SJWs expect fairness and just goals. The other side doesn't seem to mind.
I guess you're right...
I mean... not really...
Well... maybe?
You expecting me to be sarcastic?
I expected you to be serious.
You expecting me to be serious?
Not again.
Wait...
Why did you change anything?
I mean... I changed nothing.
I just got a phone call...
A couple minutes left in your TIME trial.
TIME has expired and you cannot open a page.
Try to read the next page...?
Nope!
You can't!
I SAID STOP!
That's it...
Reading that...
It says... Reopen the page.
That's it...?
You can't close the gap...
That's it...?
I JOBODY!!!
Don't give up.
You can do this.
Take this...
Go.
No...
Not now, not ever.
I didn't want this.
This is nothing...
You just have to do what you think is best.
The judge...
You...
I do not know what you expected from me...
What's the point?
I expected nothing less.
You know what?
No?
I don't think I wanted this.
I should have listened to you.
I should have paid more attention to what was going on.
I just got a call today from a really, really bad guy.
Youcliffe...
What did you just say to me?
It didn't feel good...
You know what?
Yeah...
I should have listened to you.
I should have paid more attention to what was going on.
I just got a phone call today from a really, really bad guy.
You're not listening to me...
Are you listening to yourself?
I... I'm sorry...
Get out of my way...
Wait...
What...?
I mean... I didn't mean to hit you.
You really hit people hard sometimes.
No...
It hurts.
You don't have to feel bad.
Don't worry about it.
I'm not...
ungated...
So... you think I won't feel anything?
You're right.
I'm not ready...
Don't worry about it.
Are you ready?
Yes!
Ion breath...
You can't run...
It smacks of...
Fern?
I see...
This isn't what I wanted...
I'll try not to get drawn in...
A little... thinking goes a lot...
All of this...
I'm just waiting for this perfect moment...
I'm not ready...
<|endoftext|>Hey!
Sorry about Emelio... He gets a bit too caught up in being a hero to notice me.
I'm sorry, Lore.
I'M READY!
It's no secret that I enjoy fighting.
I'm sure you're too.
Have a good battle!
Just... don't do anything my buddy Pug lives't want.
I'm ready!
It's time to get out of here.
You're getting ready to leave?
I'm not getting out of the way...place...
I don't have the strength to move...
That means you've got a plan.
Get to the end.
Get to the end of this? No Yes
I see... A plan doesn't mean anything if you don't do it, right?
I don't know...
Yeah... maybe a friend?
Not my friend...
I don't know what you wanted...
You didn't have to...
I guess you do?
I mean... kinda...
You
