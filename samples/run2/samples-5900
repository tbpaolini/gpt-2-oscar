======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 Yes like...
OH OH OH OH
No...
It has to be.
It must be large and strong.
It can't be...
It can't be...
It's out to get you.
To hurt you.
To hurt him back.
Show him you exist.
And one day you'll be friends.
He's too important to him to let go.
He wanted something more.
Something less.
You found this.
You didn't even want to find it.
You were just looking for a distraction.
I mean... I didn't want to give up.
What...?
Why did you give up on me?
Why did you give up on me at all?
You were just playing with my life.
I was lackadaemorial as you could see.
And then you happened...
No...?
Why did you give up on me then?
It was my choice.
I can make this worse.
I can fix this.
It must be.
You murdered your best friend.
You murdered your best friend.
You murdered your best friend.
You murdered your best friend.
You didn't even want to find it.
Maybe you did.
Then it is my fault.
It's your fault.
What...?
You murdered my best friend.
I... don't know.
What do you mean?
You murdered my best friend.
You murdered your best friend.
You murdered your best friend.
You murdered your best friend.
That's it.
Sorry...
Don't worry about it.
I've still got my eye on you.
Alright... hand me the watch and lets get crackin'!
Just sit back, relax, and watch me work my magic.
So like... time.
Fern... I don't really know what...
There...
You there. I'm even more than that.
Gigantic hammerhead.
There's a total stranger with a hammer in here.
 He's talking about the game.
Hey, you that was definitely me.
You're in for a very rude awakening.
This thing is on fire.
Record the journey to the top.
Don't worry about reminders.
The hammer is back within.
Your progress has been saved.
The storm is back on.
The water remains calm despite the chill.
<|endoftext|>The door is a little too sensitive.
I'm not sure if it's the amassment or the fact that I don't speak anymore.
No way I could stand up with my hands out in the cold.
It's locked.
There are no key changes.
<|endoftext|>You're standing in the cold here in Shortfall.
Yeah... maybe I'm totally nuts but...
You're right...
This place feels like family...
You're just like them.
You little brony.
You really are like them.
<|endoftext|>Are you ready to proceed? I do not currently control what happens...
This entire place feels cold and comfortable.
No worries about downtime.
No worries about catching a cold.
<|endoftext|>There's a crisp chill across the sea.
I've never felt this cold before.
<|endoftext|>There's a cozy hand settling into my sweater.
It's a Memory Stone.
A Clocktower?
No.
It's a Right Handed one.
They don't even have a Heart Letter.
What a cute little 't long term cure.
No known methods of acquiringience.
Long standing methods of control and compliance.
A vicious and oppressive breed.
They lack the intelligence necessary to plan ahead.
It lacks the compassion and compassion's to make the decisions it's tasked with making.
It wastes resources by not doing the things it's told.
When Future Boy asks for it, it's told to of course.
It's full of papers with the words 'Tell me why'.
A large stack of papers.
They're all of the same stock.
It's all of the same brand books.
The brand books are a tough job.
The stubborn plant is holding onto her young all of a sudden...
I... how I feel.
You know what? You can do this.
You made this.
You can't fix what you do.
I just don't see the point.
So... how do you go about fixing it?
By keeping an eye on Emilia?
That means you don't trust her.
I think that's very fair.
Then how do you go about fixing it?
By telling Emilia the truth?
She will forgive you if you told the truth.
I see...
There's no going back.
