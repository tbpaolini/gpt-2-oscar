Well you should have stuck with your gut.
My gut?
Yeah dude. You were right... You told me to go with my heart.
But then you second guessed yourself...
Of course I did.
I don't know you, or Rhode. At least... not really.
How could you expect me to help you?
You know... you're not wrong.
You also kind of suck.
What...?
When we went to lunch you didn't help at all.
You just sat there dodging flowers.
Then you told me you wanted to fail.
Well maybe I did.
Well maybe you suck.
And now I'm dead. So maybe everything sucks.
It's all fun and games until the deer hits the fan isn't it?
Are you... really dead?
Yeah... I guess?
If I'm not then what is this place?
Like, look at those things.
The heck is that? Honestly...
I try not to think about them...
Yeah... maybe that's for the best.
When we went to lunch you didn't fill a single basket.
Yeah and I told you it wasn't my fault.
You try catching a bunch of stuff with a basket on your head.
Huh... that kinda messed me...
You could say the same about me.
Hey look...
All of this really hurt me.
I couldn't be here...
I didn't have anything to say.
Nothing you could say.
Then we was done with this.
Yeah well, yeah.
Don't worry about it.
Yeah well, yeah.
A little later lies Kristoff's...
What...?
A bunch of flowers.
What are you talking about?
There's a cute little plant in here.
Jellyfish?
Yes.
This is kind of funny.
You'll understand when you meet them.
They seem kinda down.
What...?
They seem pretty stressed out.
That's just the way I am.
You'll understand when you meet them.
They seem kinda more stressed out.
Yeah...
They're kind of the secret...
We can work with that later.
Hey, dad?
Yeah?
Good! I know you're in charge here.
I really can't say that...
It's not for you.
What do you want from me?
Nothing.
You're right... I'm the Boss.
I'm the actual boss here.
What?
I don't wanna run into you.
Why do you think I'm out of options, kid?
Because if I was either I...
Or you're right...
I'm trying not to happen.
Mommy... I'm really sorry.
Really?
Yeah, I guess?
I think I should be apologizing.
I guess what?
Yeah, sorry?
Yeah I should be apologizing.
Hah, really?
Why do you think I need this...?
Why did you need to be this way?
I... I don't know.
I just think it hurt so much that it hurt so quickly.
I don't know...
I feel bad about it...
It didn't have to be this way.
Hrm...
Yeah... maybe you're right.
I should have stuck with my gut.
I really should have stuck with my gut.
It's just... hard.
We should have stuck to our word.
We should have stuck to our word.

Hey, uh... that's kind of messed up...
Yeah.
Sorry.
Think twice before you speak again.
In light of recent events.

Yeah?
Yeah.
I just don't want to be that person.
You sure?
I'm sort of wiped out from the outside. afoot...
That's okay.
It's kind of comfy.
I'm sure you'll be home soon.
Heh... You're kind of a jerk.
Hey, uh... are you ok?

I'm sure you're ok.
That's enough.
Lunch with a side of tortilla chips.
