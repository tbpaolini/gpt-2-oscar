======== SAMPLE 1 ========
me here for real.
Hey, thanks.
I mean, that's pretty obvious.
You've never met her before?
No.
So do you think you can go first?
First meet the people who love them so much.
What do you mean?
Go to the pool. Do your best.
Maybe we can go first?
Well I mean... maybe.
Well...
Nothing...
Well...
FUCK YOU.
You told me to do this.
You told me to fix this.
You told me to live this way.
<|endoftext|>Look at you.
Destroying everything in your path.
You wanted to hurt him.
You wanted to hurt everyone in your path.
I VOTE YOU ON THIS!!!
I VOTE YOU ON THIS!!!
I VOTE YOU ON THIS!!!
You wanted to hurt him.
You chose a wrong path.
You chose to hurt him.
I AM THE MOST INCREDIBLE WEIRD THING INNOCENT!!!
I'LL MAKE SURE HE'S IN FACT THE BEST THING INGITY!
Seriously...?
You really want to help him?
I mean... I was kind of a jerk a minute ago...
Don't worry about it. Everyone makes mistakes.
Don't worry about it.
I guess you're right... Let's blow this popsicle stand out.
You dare?
No...
Look at you.
This is bad...
Get Joe out of my way.
He's on his way to work.
Well done.
Nice and neat.
Don't worry about it.
I understand now.
Alright...
Go find Joe.
You found Joe.
He's covered in sweat.
Oh nice, there's a coffee.
There's a delicatessen at the top. Cut... Don't press F again.
Sit down, Joe.
Hey...
What are you doing here?
I shouldn't be doing this.
Hey, you're not doing this.
Come on down, Joe.
Hey...
Yeah, relax.
You want to be a hero?
Yeah... I wanted to be a hero.
That's the spirit.
Check the brown paperbag door. No more vain attempts at touching it.
Oof...
Toilet paper?
It's full of something nasty.
You can't even pick it up.
Look at you...
Man, you're gone.
Maybe I didn't break any laws.
No...
Don't worry about it.
Keep going?
Never thought about it that way.
Well, here we go.
There we go, big green hit the ground wait...
Ahh...
That's still not enough...
Throw in the... medical...?
That'll do.
What about medical advice?
We're in Early Access so I don't have much time.
Really?
Yeah, don't give up.
So... what do I have to do?
Starts with the desk.
Access to the internets is restricted.
This is really bad.
We need to get back to work.
Oh yeah... Another snack is on the way.
Use this to your heart's content.
I know you can't, but...
We are back in Early Access so feel free to get some rest and eat soon.
Hey Binder, you two were catching up on work before us.
Yeah, we were.
Eugh....
You again?
Yeah, sorry. I was just thinking about something.
So you're back in town for the weekend?
Yeah, coming back is like having a new job.
Nice.
With that done let's get going then.
Alright, I'm on my way.
Sealed up with snakes and bugs in every way. Looks like water under the bridge.
There's a newspaper in here. What do you think about them?
Pretty much.
We don't have much time so far...
Let's get you a seat at the table. Thanks for the coffee!
Anything for Joe.
Yeah, sure. Let's go, Claudio.
Nice.
And then I meet you there.
So... how are things going?
Well I mean... it's kind of grim.
You're right. grim.
I mean... it's grim.
You're right. You're right.
Yeah... but only if you're really dead.
Oh yeah...
You're also only going to anyway.
Oh yeah...
Don't worry about it. We don't need you.
Hey, you make it here.
I'M READY TO REJOIN OUR CAMPAIGN!
It's finished.
TO THE MINES, SAID QUICKLY
