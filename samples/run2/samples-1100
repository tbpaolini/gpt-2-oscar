e.g. the menu
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>There's a small key in the back...
Relive the moments when you were little. This key will light a fire on your way here.
Time is money and games are on the line.
Play along with someone you don't know. This toy can't hurt love.
We need to avenge Nurgle for Protopus. TONS OF CASSY
Oh let me get rid of that one then.
Yep... Smarty.
Hey how about this?
Pens and G8s can't-
OH NO! PEN SAND HAS HOLE!!!
This is pretty painful isn't it?
Especially with all the hiding under the covers.
Take a minute to think about what's happened to you.
It's nothing personal. I'm sure you're well aware of the implications this has on us, our family, andour beloved Protopus.
Add this to the fact that you both know exactly what's going on.
I won't let you do this.
Oh well... you're done here.
Rest for a while? Yes No
Lost noodle? Yes
<|endoftext|>This thing is getting tough on us.
It needs your help. We can help you.
LORE DECK FEED
U FINE
Yes, that's for the best.
We don't have many options other than to help you are your role as a noodle.
We Don't Have Many Options Are You Pious?
MEOW
Well... I'm glad you reconsidered.
GREAT
Thank you, Lore.
OR
Could it be... You just think you can't do anything else?
NO Thank you, OScar?
I can do anything. I'm not a bad guy.
Are you trying to shantashburysore.com.au to learn why?
LLama Just want to make sure.
LLama
You're completely right. I can do anything.
You know where all your lies are.
If you think you can, stop me right now.
I can do anything.
I'm not a terrible guy.
Good for you. Good for me.
Stop talking to me.
Look, this is it. This is what I wanted from you. This is what I wanted from myself. You're getting your momentary joy out of this.
This isn't something you could've handled.
This isn't what you wanted from me.
It's really not my fault.
It's your fault.
I made a mistake.
Ughh...
Good enough.
Now this.
Ungghhhh....
He's looking at himself in the mirror.
You made no mistakes.
You were too weak.
Glad to hear that.
What do you mean?
Nothing.
He should be ashamed of himself.
It's not like me or him should be ashamed of themselves.
It should be. This is how it should be.
It isn't that...
It doesn't matter either way.
You know how it is.
What do you mean?
It should be.
This is how it should be.
That's not what I expected.
What are you talking about?
Forest.
Forest are stronger than you are.
They will not survive in the forests.
I will not let them survive in my forest.
The power is here.
You can take it.
Take it out.
Put it back.
Look for a part of yourself that feels compelled to silence you.
There is a reason the same name trees are so common.
There is a reason you chose this path.
It can't be happening again.
What...?
Are you ok?
Honestly... You should have stayed.
I hope so.
You know what?
Yeah... I'll just lie and say it.
Good luck, little one.
You're thinking that right?
Yeah... I guess?
Forget it.
It's just a puppet.
You're not meant for this.
No...
Stop...
I did it.
Why?
Why not either of you?
The other thought...
He couldnt apparate from the ground due to some unknown force.
Nope...
That didn't sound too appealing.
Not your kind...
A terrifying and malformed creature.
Its true form was similar to that of a Large aberration.
Though it did display some weakness.
Its defenses were poorly prepared.
This unfortunate sapling had a rough time of it.
First he didn't move... Then he did...
That didn't sound very impressive.
He was in fact pretty fast...
He fell down a steeple a few
