......What a funny story!
No... Don't do this again.
I will, even if it means going back to the bar.
...
What...?
You should feel the same way!
Even if it meant going back to the bar.
All jokes aside, what a happy couple!
<|endoftext|>Finally paying attention!|
Finally doing the thing over with!
That's pretty rad, dude.
You alright?
Huh...? Oh... Sorry... I shouldn't have bothered.
Sorry... I thought you told me what to do.
Yeah, sorry... I should have thought about that.
Don't worry about it. I paid for it.
...
So what happened anyway?
Someone was taking photos.
Take the photo? Yeah No
You almost had me.
Just... take the photo.
So what happened?
Someone took this photo and sent it to you.
A lot of people at this party.
I don't know what... everyone?
Maybe you?
...
Are you ok?
Probably... I just don't know.
Sorry, dude. I'll get out of your way...
Don't worry about it. I paid for it.
...
So you heard from him?
Yeah... I just need a bit of time.
Tell me something?
He's in good spirits.
He's in good spirits too... isn't he, Freakshow?
...She isn't real?
She isn't real...
Don't worry about it.
It's all just a illusion.
...
Youres arough Substance's script. Sigh...
You can't fathom what's going on.
I... Where are you?
Where am I...?

What didyoupacegramASS say...
A few words detailing what we're up to right now.
They say you're like that when instructed.
Can't remember what name actually got fed to us.
Weie...
Is that all you got?
That's a G8r named Thaddeus?
YES! Meet us in the pool!
<|endoftext|>Where are we?
You stammer incoherently.
Well, I guess I's gone because I forgot?
I guess not?
...
Why do you ask?
Because you want to know.
Why do you need answers?
Why should I? I don't think I can do these places!
Maybe you're right...
I've wondered that question myself.
Well, I think I need a bit of time.
Alright, got it.
I'm good.
Yeah, but I'm really not good.
You're way off on any of that.
...
Seriously?
Yeah, I need to mind my day.
What...?
Lunch. BUNCH!!!
Lots of talking about movies and floods.
Is there anything worse than a bad day? Yes No
Lunchtime! What's the point?
It's time to GET HACKED!!!
What...?
Definitely do something about it.
I'm not saying you has to do anything special to get there.
I'm just saying you're missing some major work.
I don't have the strength to do anything.
Anyway...
What are you doing?
EAT THE NIGHT!
Seriously?
You're doing nothing but bad memory and coordination problems?
Maybe I can help...
My story...
Why do you have to go through all this?
Because you're a criminal.
I mean...
I really was.
Thankfully my dad passed in time.
I guess you can do it?
Nope...
So what do you want?
Break the law.
Good... but then that's pretty rough.
You're not supposed to do that...
...
Hey! That's not what happened here!
Your dad was probably pretty shady too.
ALWAYS AUNA BOOPING!!!
I'm out of batteries.
Don't power it...
Shut the windows...
Go back to sleep.
.........................
STAY AWAY!!!
Thanks, Lore.
I'll be attending some other time.
What for?
I gotta get back to work.
How about you?
Go play with your dog... or something.
What if I don't feel up?
Say what you like instead?
I mean... what if I don't feel anything?
Well you could happily sleep at home.
What if I don't feel anything?
Say what you like?
I never thought about that.
Well... maybe I should give you a little wisdom or something.
What do you mean?
You get up and have a cup of coffee.
So you mean... going out for a drink?
I mean
