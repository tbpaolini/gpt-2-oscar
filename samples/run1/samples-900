======== SAMPLE 1 ========
formed, obedient animals who enjoy company with other animals. They share a bed of fine woods and verdant meadows.
A small but well-kept stone kennel stands in its garden. A small windowless cave-in reveals deep water passages.
The birds are now quiet. A few deep but still very bright.
<|endoftext|>What is that...?
It's... stone?
It's a pickax.
Cristina says to be quiet.
Crisa?
Yes! I need this to sleep!
Catch a minute? No Yes
Sleeping seems impossible under the bright colors of this object.
It's too quiet to hear.
Well, I'm almost over having lunch. Talk later.
Took me a minute. You look a bit younger than you are.
Well... why not?
Because I'm super hungry.
Well... why do you have so much food rage? I'm a professional. I produce quality products.
Your teeth sound like paint but come at you like sidings.
Do you have any complaints about us working at the pizzeria Bistro OScar?
Not really, thanks.
Pizza? Nah no.
I... yeah, I hate pizza.
Well, you don't hate pizza. At least, not with that cheesy cheesy sauce.
Wait... you hate pizza? You mean... the rest of the food.
That's just rude.
Fine! You hate me.
I just do my best and I feel pretty good about it.
Fine! You hate me.
...
It's full of... rotten eggy taste?
...Sickass...
It's full of... sour taste?
...Sickass... It's full of... full of salt?
No! It's just a label.
It's full of... miscellaneous scraps?
Nope!
...LOL...
It's full of... waste eggs?
Nope!
<|endoftext|>This is the start of every horror movie I've ever been in.
The monster is tough and the look on their faces makes me sick.
The water cooler doesn't have a running water function.
The music doesn't play while the other two work.
Record a new record with that one job.
You can't hear the monster either.
<|endoftext|>There's a small key in here.
There's a phone with a lot of numbers in it.
Wh... what...?
Come here! I need this pole replaced.
Yeah, sure. Is it time to get poleky?
Pleasure to meet you. All of you here replace some power at the pole.
So, where is the job posting say?
Situated here waiting for someone to replace your... inability.
A bit of a miscalculation on your part. The surge path seems to have weak points.
I would've taken that as written here.
Wait a second... Did you really just threw a pole on this day?
Well... no.
Still wouldn't do an engineering job like what I was doin.
What with all of this polefooting.
What with all of this power? This thing is super efficient. Why would I need anything less?
Why would I need anything less? This thing can do anything? Every pocketwatch I've ever worked with is designed for every job.
Working in a power plant is super dangerous.
Even without a power source I don't mean to smacking them with a garbage can.
Let's go, Joe. Get the power plant under control.
<|endoftext|>Hey power plant whaddya doing here power plant in this plant nothing...
Wait... power plant?
Yeah this is all bad energy. Let's get you a sweater.
Awsome today, power plant nerd.
Hey power plant whaddya doing here power plant in this power plant nerd.
Hey power plant, what's the power condition like here?
This thing seems super cool. We have no idea.
My sweater looks neat and simple. I'll be setting the rack on the elevators when I get a shirt.
Awkward silence.
Your fault we didn't go faster. Not now.
The power company is talking to a corporate HR rep. Make sure to follow their every move.
<|endoftext|>How many of these projects originally came from just one?
How many...? Tower defense.
Maybe a few. Tower engineering.
We need engineers like you. We need engineers like you.
Let's find those engineers.
We need engineers like you. Engineering out of design.
We need engineers like you. We need engineers like you.
We need engineers like you. Engineering out of passion.
We need engineers out of overreach.
We
