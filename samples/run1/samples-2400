 the next day. What a waste of time! Let's go pick up Fern. Yeah and I got a feeling it's Hot out here.
...
...
This power can be hurtier to come face with...
...
It's full of secrets and untold treasures.
What could make the world go dark when this was just a dream?
Why would anyone leave a secret when they could just as easily be Secretariat?
This power can turn mundane objects into powerful tools.
A deliciously painful memory is looping itself back together.
That's quite a haul for such a small axe.
Oh...
I shall endeavour to procure the most valuable fragment upon completion.
The deliciously painful memory arrives in a pointed and crushed state.
Wh... what...?
This object is of questionable legality.
...
It may yet prove useful to us.
Or may not prove beneficial to you.
As you determine.
Storage vessel...
Storage vessel...
<|endoftext|>The vessel is of medium strength and very comfortable materials.
The inhabitants of the cave tongue cycle are of humble origins. They enjoy a humble pastime amidst the hard wood and hard dat.
It is currently occupied by a nervous deer.
A pair of large shavings are glued to the body. This grants the deer greater strength.
The shavsh is removed and glued to the deer's back. This grants him greater intelligence.
Duck? What's that?
This object is of unknown quality.
Unidentified object type material. The materials are unsharpened and glued together.
The object then collides creating a tsunami of memories.
A cowboy hat is placed next to the object.
The fractious beast scurries away.
The object dissipates into the surrounding darkness.
The object you so grudgingly pointedly avoided.
The object you so deliciously pointedly avoided.
The deer scurries away.
THE DEER?
HE'S TURKEY!
