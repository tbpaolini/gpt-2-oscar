======== SAMPLE 1 ========

Here is a friend I will call dad...
How dare you think I'm his dad again...
Dad...
You're not even his dad...
This is... wrong...
This must have been super rude...
Don't worry about it... it will be over soon...
Dad...
Hey... are you alright?
Yeah sorry, I didn't mean to come in.
Are you ok?
Yeah sorry?
What did you just just say to me?
You're kind of lying.
I'm sorry... I didn't mean to come in.
Are you ok?
I don't know you really are that bad son.
You're very gentle son.
You're very kind son.
...
Hey look, that was mine.
What did you just say to me?
You're kind of wrong.
I should have listened to you.
Don't worry about it. It's just a habit.
Hey hey son.
That was mine.
You know what?
No.
Well I mean...
You're wrong.
You really are wrong.
I'm sorry, I'mitation.
Did you just say I'm sorry?
Nope.
What did you just say to me?
You're kind of a sweet little tree.
You like that?
Nope.
...

<|endoftext|>Filled with sarcastic comments and rude comments about yourself.
This is it. This isn't going to go any better.
I got the look.
So... how do you fix this?
Add water? Ice bucket ride.
Or...
Or...
Or...
Or...
Or...
Oh...
The taste of your sleep.
Taste of sleep.
What...?
Sleep better not second guess yourself.
You know... I've got a confession to make.
Beg pardon?
Yeah... I think I'm here...
Time to get out of here.
Get a good shot.
A good shot?
Uh...
Don't you think you're a pretty good shooter?
Shot like hell.
You startling to see what's wrong.
Oh...
Don't lighten the mood. We need to go back.
Why not?
Well... I'm not mad.
...
I don't think I could get past how about this...
...
So how do you fix this?
Add water? Ice bucket ride.
Or...
Or...
Or...
Or...
Oh...
You're wasting my time. Why don't you go see a movie.
Sure.
What?
Something fishy about your cause.
...
<|endoftext|>So you want to spend the night.
Are you sure?
Yeah... we've been friends for a pretty intense minute.
Except... you're not a pretty sight.
...
<|endoftext|>*2_STOP ABLEING INCREDIBLY
REPLY ON THE FOOD!!!<|endoftext|>Why do you ask?
He's a dumb foodie. Why would I ask foodies like that?
Of course... foodies ask dumb questions.
So you want to help him grow.
What do you think foodies are good at?
He can't do anything concrete.
He's just taking what little he has.
That's it?
Come back and watch us fight.
Or is he going to give you a beating?
The food has already been eaten. You're done for.
He gave you a beating back. Even if you survive.
You really are going to like it.
Can't you do something about it?
I mean... maybe.
You really are better served by being real.
A bomb went off in here.
There was a lot of water damage. All the way through.
There were too many chemicals in there. At least this size.
It's empty then.
It's not that bad though.
Just a lot more water damage. All the way to the X.
This isn't that spot you intended.
Not worth the time and energy. Just telling yourself.
What if I'm going to stay here?
What if you're not going to guess?
You better get the neanderthal out of here.
No...
You can't be serious.
You've never stopped learning.
You've always been funny.
This is life after that.
Imagine you could fix this whole thing.
It's not that hard at all.
Except you would have to spend so much money to do it this way.
You really are an egg man.
I wouldn't want to spend my hard earned money on one of those projects.
I mean, you're right.
