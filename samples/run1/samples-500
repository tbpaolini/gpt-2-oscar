======== SAMPLE 1 ========
You. Stop looking so ridiculous.
You made it this far.
Wow... You look super tough.
You almost had my brain...
You know what? Let's roll!
Seeya!
Thanks for taking my time with your journey.
Have fun and have a great month!
...
Hey, buddy!
Yeah, really.
I just wanted to say that I'm kind of sick of you guys wasting time on superpowered monsters.
No idea what you're into...
Not much anyway...
Now onto this one.
<|endoftext|>What a monster.
Typical for your kind of terrain.
...
You finished him? Nah No.
...
You think I'm nuts? Be happy. Be happy.
Is he still alive? Nah No.
...
So he's not? He's fighting for his life right?
Nope.
...
Wait... maybe you're just nuts?
Well yeah. Let me put it this way...
You know what, I'm sick of you. You jerkass.
I'm sick of you.
...
Wait... this isn't going to go well?
I mean, sometimes you have to be realistic.
Yeah...
You're right, dude. You're right, dude.
You got me straight away.
You got me straight away.
No problem.
This is the right place at the right time.
You know what? Nah No.
...
...
Uhh... what was that?
Hey dude, you got me.
Yeah dude. Need I say more?
Yeah dude. Need I say more?
Uhh... no.
...Now play with your shield...
...Now play with your mind game...
...Now hit the run.
...Now get out and do it.
...Now play with your eyes closed and take a run at it.
...Now that it looks scuffed it's actually got a heart.
...Now it feels like you're taking a shot.
...Now it feels silly.
No...
What...?
It's a stick.
...
Filled with greasy pickle nastiness.
...The only food pod in here is crunchy.
Filled with... greasy?
Food pods that taste like pickle nastiness.
You know what to do. Good. Muffled.
Good?
No. Because it's super powered.
Yeah. Like... super powered.
Seriously?
Nah. Like you're boring.
...
...
Oh... I don't really remember any of this happening...
Oh hey. Come hang with me while I figure it out.
The elevator is already starting and the sun is out.
Imagine if you can get there?
Sounds like fun!
Seeya.
The world seems smooth again.
Just... like before.
Just... like now.
So... you have a superpowered brain?
Not really... not like... anything...
What does superpowered have to do with superpowered living?
Life... love...
How do you define love?
Compassion. Trust. Staying true to who you are.
I use these terms to describe myself during my time as a data scientist in Massachusetts. I'm not a data nerd though.
<|endoftext|>...He won't come back...</endoftext>
...He won't come back...</endoftext>
...Wait... what...? What do you mean... weakness...? Just love.
Just love.
...It's only natural... Why would you do this...?...If you don't love then...
I hope you figure it out already.
...You're wasting my time...</text>
......I don't know...
Maybe I was hoping for it...
...But what if now?... Why won't you?
Maybe it's just a bad memory...
...Maybe you're being a bit ambiguous...
...I just don't know...
Maybe it's just a memory...
...
...What...?!... We already know...
...She lied to you...</text>
<|endoftext|>...She pushed you...
She pushed you to her...
...She helped you...
There you are. Happy to go about your business.
Yeah well... What's the catch?
I want to talk to you about how you've been playing games for a while.
A lot.
Yeah... you really should.
However you define gaming, like most things do in real life.
Especially with the food chain.
Yeah well... yeah I totally get it.
But don't worry about it. You've got a good heart and I'm not pushing you out of your game.
What is?
A good friend and I
