 Yhhh... hm...?
Huh...? Filled with such a nice assortment of emotions. There's always 'em...
Eat at once! The first bite is enough to feed the HUNGRY person.
...
I see you've met the others yet...
Are you ready to proceed?
Yes...Go?
Alright then. I will begin.
The Faceless take the challenge.
Hey... I'm the challenge!
Give them what they order? Rice? Ham? Go with ham.
Don't worry about it. I've got your back.
The challenge is up!
Take your time. Think about what you're doing.
What did you just say to me?
I know you're in control...
Take this... and throw it away!
What...?
Just give me a minute.
Nothing...
What...?
Expect more...
Give it a minute...

Take all of this...
Why do you need this...?
Why am I being asked this question...
Why do you need this...?
Take all of this...
Why don't you go?
Leave a mistake...
I'm not an animal.
All I know is how I'm handled and if I'm not doing my job well I will be held responsible.
Good luck out there.
Try to steal a flower.
You found a pair of dark green pumps.
Nice! You want more?
Want to know more?
Just tell me.
What is that?
You're a tiny mushroom.
Look... I'm not hungry.
Well maybe a little?
You're wrong.
I'm a tiny mushroom.
Well yeah. You should eat less plastic surgery.
You're gross.
Neat. I meant 'nervous'.
Eat like a Beast. Like a worm.
Not going to happen.

You're levitating like a dumpster fire.
Nice.
I'm keeping an eye out for you.
How do you feel?
GO WITH ME!
...
So you're trying to cast a spell?
You're levitating like a trashcan.
I mean... you're not the trashcan.
You are... and I'm going to keep doing this.
You're not going to stop asking me like... why am I here.
You're not going to stop touching me.
Oh boy... I'm done with this.
Hey, I'm still here...
Sorry...
Don't worry about it. I'm sure...

So you're not going to stop touching me?
No...
...
Well then... I'm done with this.
Hey, think about it.

You're no longer with us.
This is real life.
