...
...We'll see you on the board...
Just... be careful around...
...Vaporcave eyes...
a shrine to indecisive fermentation...
...An open field to enjoy the breeze...
A shallow vernal forest...
A handball-sized vial fills the void...
A fresh chest full of trash...
A cheesy synth chiclet...
A sock puppet...
...A bunch of sad looking people...
...You think I'm pretty?...
You're pretty but you look a lot like her.
A couple of sockpuppy friends sit around a fire.
A toad is smarmatlanously smarmated with a stick.
...
A bookpair sit in a field with noils being dropped on the floor.
<|endoftext|>Hey!

Yeah... is that alright, Lor?
...
Seriously?
Yeah, great. Here's a dollar to every bad apple you find.
Just don't overstep, dig...
A couple of guffawy faces sit in a field.
A couple of grumpy faces sit in a field.
A couple of sweet and sour faces sit in a field.
...
A bunch of 'er... flowers?
No.
...
A bunch of stuff you just didn't want in here.
A couple of 'er... objects?
Yep.
...
...
A bunch of stuff you really wanted?
Nope!
<|endoftext|>Hey.
I know you do.
What do you think this is?
If you think I should touch anything...
please don't touch me again.

...
Seeya.

<|endoftext|>An ant sits on the edge of the planter.
Visions of yourself in a labcoat surrounded by ants swirl in your head.
The ant managed to escape while you were deep in ant based fantasies.
A planter filled with lovely well-kept flowers and not even a hint of ants.
These smell like chocolate? CHOCOLATE?! CHOCOLAAAAAAAAAAATE!!!
A faint hint of caramel wafts through the air.
These flowers smell absurdly delicious. Your mouth waters at the very thought of them.
You quickly devour one of the flowers. It tastes like sawdust and sadness.
Eat one of the flowers? What could go wrong? That's a pretty bad idea.
It may smell nice but it tasted nasty.
It may smell nice but it's probably not safe to eat.
Hey... did you need something?
Sorry! I was just looking for someone.
I uhh... don't really know what I'm doing.
Oh wow, look at the fur on you!
That's just my sweater.
I'm not wearing any fur...
Yeah ok, sure. Anyway... whaddya doing in my yard?
SOMEONE'S IN THE YARD?!
Rhode...

...
RHODE!
Yeah?
Everything is fine ya big dork.
Oh... Sorry... I'll get out of your way...
Don't mind her. She means well.
I'm kind of used to weird outbursts at this point.
Neat I guess? Anyway... what did you need?
Emelio said to come find Fern to help me fix this pocketwatch.
Hey that's me!
You're Fern?
No. Clearly, I'm Emelio.
...
Oh don't look at me like that. I'm just ribbin' ya.

Well yeah. That's why I'm here.
Yeah but, this is super messed up. Like totally messed up.

Heart pounding in your chest.
You're going to hurt me...
You're seriously going to try catching me now.
