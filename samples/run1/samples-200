======== SAMPLE 1 ========
You. How much of what's on here is on that shelf? Don't you ever want it back? 'Cause you know what? You don't.
'Cause I'm a crook.
'Till when you're a crook.
Yeah... I guess...?
Seeya, new guy. So... what do you think about this?
Hrm... What do you think?
Thanks. I want you to know that this isn't your ordinary old fashioned time machine. It's... it's not even...
Hrm...
Welp, got it. Guess you should take a minute to think over it.
Welp, got it. It works... Now look at this...
Poke?
Heh... That's a lot of pipes thrown at you by the wrong people.
Welp, heh... What are you waiting for...? Don't worry, I'll get you straight to work.
Poke? Don't worry, I'll get you straight to work.
Hrm... You seem kind of lost.
Maybe I should take a nap.
Pun...
It's full of... food?
Nope. Not even a single stick of meat.
Possibly...?
Alright...
Dang...
You're getting tired of this job.
Maybe you have something else on you.
It's full of a basket full of food. Don't worry, I'll get you fixed.
What is this...?
Just a bunch of garbage.
Wait... what...?
Googlem...?
Fucking basket of garbage? Ouch...
Don't worry about it.
So I used to work here?
Nope...
So I can work at home?
I'm kind of rude.
Oh yeah, but you're supposed to be rude.
Yeah, I know.
...
You just made a bunch of garbage and then some.
Nice.
Seriously?
You made all those garbage sandwiches with your garbage.
...
<|endoftext|>Wait... what...?
Hey I'm Chomper!
Yo hey hey!
You should always be Chomper.
You're pretty decent though.
You just kind of sit there thinking all these trash talking stuff.
What happened to those plastic ducks?
They took forever to pick up.
So you took forever to pick up those plastic ducks?
Yeah I guess.
Man it got tough.
These things don't even even exist.
There you go, stick around for some weird snack I guess?
Anyway...
So you have some kind of magical object in this bag.
Maybe you can use those for something?
Uhh... No Yes
It tastes gross but really... It's pretty tasty.
I'm sorry...
...
<|endoftext|>Oh, I forgot...
This place looks kinda kind of gross.
This forest seems kind of kind of gross as well.
Yeah... It's full of garbage and garbage tools too.
This forest seems kind of kind of kind of gross as well.
<|endoftext|>This place is kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of...
...
<|endoftext|>...
It's dark inside and the only light is wind.
It's hard to feel anything moving through the bag.
It smells waaay too strong for my tastes.
You can't really see him any of these places, but the kind of trees on his back feel pretty good.
He's pretty much out there eating some junk.
<|endoftext|>It's a kind of plant... Not a monster, but not big or powerful enough.
What kind of monster...?
Why do you have to choose these places over everything else?
Just choose the right one.
There's only one way to find him. Don't leave him there.
<|endoftext|>...
Nothing.
You're just supposed to fall asleep so you can do this again?
A little too early.
You look like you can't concentrate...
...You're weak...
...You shouldn't be here...
It's just... nothing...
<|endoftext|>...Why am I here...?
...I need you to let me know.
<|endoftext|>Why don't you do the same for me.
<|endoftext|>...Hey, you're not bad at this kind of thing.
I need you to be here.
Seeya!
How much is enough?
I feel really bad about making you cry.
Don't worry. What I need right now is for you to calm down.
<|endoftext|>...You're late...
...You're waiting for us...
