======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 grab, you don't have to do this. It's just my position so you can't escape.
You could have just let me play. It would've hurt so much worse.
Don't try to escape. I want control. You can't let this happen to me.
You want control? I just want my moment.
Don't tell us what you want. We can go with you.
You want to know what was on your mind? He had it all.
You don't wanna know what he wasn't thinking?
I tried to control you. Don't let him make it look like I gave him anything.
That's probably alright with him. You know what? Not everything has its moments.
You try not to think.
Don't worry. I'll be on the look-out for you.
You think I'm mad? I don't usually try to hide my emotions.
You're not mad. You're just wrong.
I didn't mean to do that.
Yeah well I'm not mad either.
You didn't mean to do anything.
You just wanted to push myself.
Don't worry about it. I want to see what's in store.
You know that.
You knew that.
You didn't expect it.
It felt good.
You know that.
Maybe maybe I wasn't expecting it.
What did you think about that?
What did you think of that?
<|endoftext|>It was nothing...
You thought your hand was safe? You passed it with nothing but your name on it.
I wanted to smash it before it worked.
You tried to smash it with a fist but it just rolled away.
It looked like it could smash you.
It didn't look like it could.
That's just how things are.
That's just how things are.
<|endoftext|>I'll give you a hint...
Don't worry about it. It didn't mean anything.
Maybe you had a bad moment together...
...I didn't mean to...
Maybe this is why you're here...
I know that. I'm just mad.
Don't worry...
Don't worry. I need this. I need this.
You could have just let me play. It would've hurt so much worse.
You just wanted to be sure.
You didn't mean to do anything.
You know that.
Maybe he was right.
Maybe maybe.
That's what you think?
You think maybe?
I guess?
I guess?
Then why don't you try this again.
...
What was that...?
You can't be me.
You know what...?
I don't know what that was really like.
You know what?
Yeah well... Anyway...
Keep your distance... Don't run.
Keep your distance?
No. Just keep going.
Yeah... Well... Just try not to run into people.
Why do you ask?
Is he dead?
What was that...?
Yeah... Something weird going on.
<|endoftext|>Don't ask.
Don't give up.
Don't give up.
What happened to him?
You can't be me.
You know what?
I don't know what this is all about.
Maybe he was right.
Maybe maybe.
Maybe this is what it feels like to be a monster.
Maybe this is what it feels like to be a monster.
Maybe this is how it feels.
I told you what...
Maybe this is how it is.
Maybe we are in the future.
Maybe we are in the future.
Maybe this is what it feels like.
Maybe this is what it feels like.
<|endoftext|>...

<|endoftext|>It was nothing...
<|endoftext|>...
...

<|endoftext|>This is it...
This is it, buddy.
This is it...

<|endoftext|>Wait...
Is that...
Scarlet Bloodlust Taunt?
You asked for it. What do you need?
Scarlet Gaze
Scarlet Frostfrost
Scarlet Whistling
Scarlet Pernicious
Scarlet Gaze is a powerful, terrifying Bloodlust Taunt, and it lacks emotion.
You may recognize it from her glowing eyes.
You are not alone in your desire to escape the Tower.
Scarlet Gaze must be the most powerful vessel in the world.
Scarlet Bloodlust is clearly drawn into your thoughts after you fail to escape.
Scarlet Gaze demands your obedience.
You will not take this foolish vessel out.
You will not take this foolish vessel back
