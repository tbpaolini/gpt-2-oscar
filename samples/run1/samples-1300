Don't worry though, Emelio. We'll get you out of here soon enough."
The three of you made it out of the room before me before you could be seen.
Though, that won't fix the bed bugs.
I'm sure you can fix it, but for the love of... the thing?

She looks nervous.
I make sure to tell my kids that I'm their dad.
I know he is and I will defend that for them.
I'm a terrible brother.

They could attack me or something? You know that.
I hope so. I'm right.
Well... What was that?

I just got out of bed. Not much to see and the breeze is getting harder.
That makes sense...
What were you thinking?
Well, I've been thinking about buying a home for a while.
That sounds awesome.
I'll let you know how it goes, looks like Home Depot is running some form of energy drink in their racks.
That makes sense to me.
If you want to buy it you could just me... just ask.
