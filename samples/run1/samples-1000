I...
Well let's see...
Is that tough going to be?
Definitely!
...
...
...
Are you going to take that off your face?
Oh yeah... I would! I mean... look at you...
How pathetic!
...
Oh yeah... I wish you could!
...
...
Oh yeah... I wish you could be a little more sarcastic.
...
...
Well let's leave this for you.
...
...
Why not...?
Well you're hanging out with that monkey.
hehe...
Hrm...
Nice try.
You're in luck.
I won't say no.
Thank you.

Are you ready yet?
Are you ready yet?
ORY... FATE...
Fate... HERE
I seen...
Here she is cuddling up to your mountain of fuzz. She looks... like most animals.
I mean... seriously... check the food. It looks pretty gross.
Your eyes widened in shock as you ate her. It looks like your eyes were glued to the screen.
It's doing really ok so far. Keep it up Lore!
Oh wow...
You look really refreshed. Also...ll I have my lunch before we go?
GREAT! Come sit with me right here in your cubicle!
Nah! Just sit by my computer for a bit.
Ugh... what did you want?
LED... FIND IRON...
Look... it's a ghost. Yeah... maybe.
Look at how bright it is. It could be dead.
Look at how it looks in your drawer. It's all green.
Look at how it looks in your dresser...
Nothing... Just a bunch of tiny dots. Something about them looks weird.
Look at how it looks covered in sticky notes.
A small knife is held to its neck...
What are you holding?
Something cute. You'll never see it.
You never shall!
...
Take this sleeper?
...
Take this toy?
Packed with... fur?
Fur...?
No! It's food!
...
This is wild animal sightlines!
Can't even reach the top!
Some animals are known for their agility!
Catch this bird? No Yes
With or without help...?
Without a nest to call your own?
Without guidance?
When will all the food vanish?
The birds round the coal tower respond with a barely audible sigh.
That's enough for now!
Yet not enough to eat?
Not enough to stay?
Not enough to stay?
That's enough for now!
Yet not enough to eat?
Full of... phytoplankton?
You wouldn't believe the amount of brown dye in that...
Ishy's Just Squeezed...
Dragging my fall on a stormy day...
Makes me a better person...
It's just a mountain of it.
Make no mistake, I am an animal.
That's the name of the game.
Baron was trying to figure that out though...
You could hit him with pretty much anything.
I could go with anyone you wanted.
We were all just like that.
It's a good thing we kept moving after the concert.
I'm not fighting anymore...
He may still be a fist-sized fist-ish counterweight, but he's getting the job done.
Replace the pocketwatch with something better.
Hope this game brings back the love cards from before you passed them around.
By the Numbers
I knew it!
It was written on the side...
That wasn't mine...
...
There it is! Professional Thread!
...
Another wise move, OScar.
...
You've lost.
That's not very cynical of you.
You and Fern share a passion for investigating even before it leads you to the next floor.
Why would you go out to lunch alone? Find food pods on the way to work?
I will answer your questions when I see them.
So you've seen them?
Towards the top...
Who made you go alone?
What set of people deserves to control what goes around me?
When I finally do I toad your way home.
You've lost count... of the times I was wrong.
Nothing worth noting, Fern.
...
I... weed a discovery over friendship here in the first place.
Not your fault... I tried!
You know what...? I wouldn't do it.
I didn't even... want to! I GREDDLE YOU!!!
Not my fault... I tried!
