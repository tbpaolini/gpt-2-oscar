The key is in a pocket inside a dark green sock.

You would expect a sock with a circular mechanism to hold more stuff.
This sock looks pretty grabby.
There's a small key to a secret cave in here.
It's not in a secret cave but someone carved a key in it.
It's a red salamander's chest.
It's a little scraggly.
It's a bunch of mud muck.
It's a tiny beard.

He looks a little rough.
That's not what happened.
I'm pretty good at this kind of thing.
Oh... sorry I's not around to hear from you.
That's Binder's domain?
Yeah... Come check it out, Joe.
Oh, sorry... OScar here.
Don't come back here again.
...
The other day, I was a bit rough.
...
You know what... don't worry about it.
You just need to be realistic about it.
Don't give up.
...
It's in there somewhere.
Pour water on him. He's calm.
Give him the water cooler. He'll call back within five seconds.

There's a small book in here. 'Time: A Business' It's a Business Business Manual.
Let's get you a hat. That's an A on here.
Looks like 'Hang in there Like an Hood' Business is dead.
Bookshelves are a must.
My buddy Darksiders help him find the hat. He thanks everyone for their help.
The haulmaster haggles down the back of the company.
You know the robot hand jerk joke, don't you?
Yeah... Yeah, well, that's pretty messed up.
It's a photo locker.
You use that to hang yourself?
Nah.
You missed a beat.
I'm not funny.
You know what, what are you?
On my terms.
On my terms?
OF COURSE!

Hey Fern!
It's your big quest!
It's always me...
Come back when you're done...
What... are you doing here?!
I... I shouldn't have...
You know what... It's yours.
I'm sorry, Dungeon Sorter.
I understand.
So now you want to go?
Really?
Yeah, what I want is to meet you before lunch.
So then everything's going to be ok?
Story-wise...
Yeah... I guess?
Well then, we have to get back to Newhire mode.
Oh wow...
Wait... really?
Sure thing, nerd.
Seeya!

<|endoftext|>There's a small key in your pocket. It feels greasy...
It's been holding sticky notes for a while. Just in time for lunch!
What's in it?
A small key...
Hold on to it! It won't work.
Could this be more... y...?
It's a pocketwatch. It looks... bitificid.
It's a bit scuffed but looks perfect.
A deliciously painful memory is tied to that object.
<|endoftext|>So we got this?
This green trash can doesn't even stand up.
Just enough wood (or maybe more wood) to hold the nestling.
There's a small nametag on here. 'Tuff' What a funny name for a spider.
Tuff?
It scales with age like a sore
