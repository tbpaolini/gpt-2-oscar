 ME.
...
How about if I tell you...
No?
Fine...
I'll try...
No?
Fine...
...Good luck out there.
Never seen enough trouble to
debate... leave
...OEISEFRINE......
...Leave me...
...ENOUGHFRINE...
...NO...
...Only...
Its time for you to do the talking.
That's my chameleon, isn't it?
Hrm...
Well, I guess you're right...
That guyfamous for taking lives in his lonely...
he also had in him a few pretty decent goals in mind.
Plot...
I'll let you know if I see anything.
Alright, time for you to leave.
So you're going to be the bad guy?
Well I mean... yeah. I'm just shy around older men.
My...
You're getting your shot though. You're doing best friend...
No...
...
Good for you.
...
...
So... head out to the woods?...
Yeah... can't miss it.
This is where the music is at. I'm noting this from experience though.
You'd be hard pressed without a scythe.
A scythe is a decent haul though.
The earth is smooth and unspoilt.
It's set well away from the forest floor.
That's a cold one.
You're cold as dirt though.
Not a soulless one though.
You're hot as dirt though.
Not a soulless one though.
...
...
Don't give up yet.
This is your chance.
Slaughter us all in under an hour.
Torn between my will and your will.
It broke during the night.
You know what you did.
You're not good enough.
I'm sure you're better.
Not enough of a her... you can be anything you want.
What...?
Don't hold back anymore.
You'll be ok but only if we get in your face.
...
Then please don't take anything for granted.
We're only here to hurt you.
You're going to get you so bad.
Just give it a shot.
It's not going to be very nice.
Just give it a few more of your besties.
One more thing.
You're always doing this.
I'm not here to say no...
Ever tried being good?
Yes...
Never tried getting better?
At least that was my gut feeling...
You just have to do it, buck the system.
What...?
Just do your best, man.
You killed my best friend.
Well maybe you followed your heart but you didn't take action.
Maybe you're right...
...You're always right...
...You're right...
...You're right...
...Black and White...
You know what...? Yeah.
You're right.
Yeah but you were wrong.
Yes...
...
Then you were right...
But you're wrong.
...You're right...
...You're right...
...But a Scorn is A Great Option...
That's pretty universal sense.
Especially when you have no idea where I was until now.
It's been incredibly cooperative...
We only got going when I said I was going to the woods.
We didn't leave until I was sure nothing would happen.
That was pretty messed up...
You know...
You are not wrong.
I did my best.
Yeah well, you didn't do anything awesome.
I mean... nobody did?
We did? We went?
Why are you wasting my time?
Why do things like that?
Why do nothing?
...You're blind...
...You'll see in time...
That's not enough...
...You're not strong...
...You'll always be pathetic...
...You're pathetic...
...Then watch your step...
...Then watch your family...
That's it...
...Be prepared...
What will your future hold?
...You will suffer greatly...
...You're going to hell...
...You're going to the sky...
<|endoftext|>Going to the sky...?
Going to the sky...?
Oh yeah... Don't forget to bring your binoculars. They can be very helpful.
Things are looking up for our brave adventurers.
Heh, I guess you're right. Let's press on you silly mutt.
Mutt?! How rude!
That lightswitch frying must have killed the power...
Must have died while I was a resource!
Privateer...
Access must be granted to this area. Management will assume leadership during the next cycle.
Definitely more compassionate than private
