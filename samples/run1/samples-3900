What...?
Just... talk.
Stop wasting my time. I have important business to attend to.
Why on earth would I waste my time?
Gross work. Just think of the paperwork.
OH!!!
Uhh... Yes!!!

<|endoftext|>Discus a soft pillow sticker on this surface.
No.
...
A Wild Population of Seeds...
Whoa, what did you just say...?
No.
...
Wake up Lore.
I know you're not ready.
No reason to continue this journey.
What did you just say?
We're going to meet up again.
What...?
What did you just say?
We're going to spend the night.
You really think I'm incapable of doing this?
Tiergh... You're not strong enough...
Don't worry. I can do it.
Just... don't... say it.
It won't work...
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.
...
With or without lettuce?
...It won't make a difference...
...You're with the terrors...
...Save them...
...Ask them what it is...
...Tell them what it is...
No...
It won't happen...
No...
It doesn't matter.
It won't.
...
I... I can do this...
...Thank you...
...Take the axe...
...You're too weak to do this...
<|endoftext|>...Look at you...
...Destroying everything in your path...
...You'll never find him...
...That's not true...
...Then why do you ask?
...Because you want to...
...You're wrong...
...They're only going to get worse...
...End the charade...
<|endoftext|>Squire...
...?
We have many paths in life.
The ones we choose aren't always the best.
But... they're ours.
They define us.
They make us who we are.
Do you know who you are? No Yes
That's not a bad thing.
What do you mean?
Life is a journey of discovery.
We don't have to skip to the end to enjoy it.
I don't understand...
It's alright if you don't right now.
You will in time.
We all do eventually.
...
I see...
There's still time to change.
Things don't have to be this way.
Do you want things to be this way? I can fix this. This is how it should be.
Do you want things to be this way? No  Yes 
I don't blame you for what you've done.
However, there is no going back.
You can't undo the past.
...
Don't worry though, Squire... You will do better.
I know you will.
We don't choose how others remember us.
Just...
Be the hero of your own story.
Even if you weren't the hero of mine.
<|endoftext|>...You were right...
...Better not break the time
...You're too skilled
...You can't catch a day that doesn't involve you
...You're right...
<|endoftext|>Baron...?
This can't be happening... Don't leave me alone... Not after all of this...
...How touching...
...Am I interrupting you?...
No no no...
Please leave us alone... We just want to go home...
...He earned this...
...You both did...
I...am sorry...
I...did...
You can't be good at this...
Just leave me alone... I didn't expect this from you...
Ellsen...?
What are you talking about?
Why did you leave me alone...?
Why did you have to leave me alone then?
Why did you have to decide if you're ready for what comes next?
We don't live in a game...
I see the same thing.
...
How do you feel?
I feel wronged.
This is not what I wanted.
What...?
You are lying to me.
What...?
What if I happened across the wrong side of...
Home?
Why do you hate me?
Why do you hate me?
Why do you hate me?
I have plans for all of you.
All of you.
...
Eleanor...
Eleanor...
...
Well, Lore...
We found hundreds of ordinary roses.
Many flowers, many hello flowers.
A perfect combination for a light hearted person.
For a heavy hearted person, it's a light hearted deal.
