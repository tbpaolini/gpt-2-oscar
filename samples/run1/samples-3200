<|endoftext|>Wait...
Am I really going to spend my hard earned cash on trash this time?
Maybe.
Well, please don't come near me while I'm gone.
Quiet...
<|endoftext|>Uhh... wow. That's really scary.
Yeah... I guess I just don't want to get into it.
What are you waiting for? Panic attack!
The smoke screen getting stronger as you approach.
<|endoftext|>Seeya!
...
This is just a regular bag... You can't even roll with the punches...
I have super good timing and I'm not an animal.
Don't worry about it. I'm ready!
Hey, take that, Russ?
The obnoxious red book is about to hand me his super cool sock!
...
Want to play with me? Good.
Show me why you're good by my nuts? Yes No
Nice and neat. Nudity allowed.
Cheap tools for expensive jokes. Good for showroom employees.
Software developer with boring pasts. Bad for reverse engineering.
My boss needs to hear... stories.
Heh, me either.
True, I'm a hottie.
TODO: This needs to be fixed in the morning so I can be a hottie...
Hey! Where's your hat? I need a hat at work.
I'm Bill Hightower, and I work here.
Hurt my company? You'll never sight in my basket.
Uhh... what did you just say?
My hat is on my head.
Wait... what?
Have you lost your edge?
I don't need your hat.
Wait...
What?
I don't recognize any assets from where I was made.
Wait...
What?
For being a HatCrafter.
Wait... what?
For Beggars Baked?
Hurt them?
I AMKING FOUNDANT!!!
I'm this guy.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
You're here to do this.
I'm Protector Thaddeus. You're the one with the powers.
Who assigned you to do this?
With the help of the coffeeshop he has.
Why?
Wash your hair. I like it here in town.
What if I don't like it?
Then you are the way I am.
Then I must be at the office.
And this is happening right now.
Things could be much worse.
I... I don't know...
Is everything alright?
Oh really?
Yeah... I just...
You sure about that?
It's not my fault.
I just happen upon a few things.
Does that mean I have to be extra careful a second time?
Of course not...
It's always easy...
I just have to be extra careful a second time.
Oh...
...
...
Oof...
That's nothing...
You just hold onto it for now.
You told me to give you power. Now you hold onto it for the greater good.
That was... wrong...
It's not your place to decide.
You can definitely do more, aren't you?
What... am I... thinking?
You're still holding onto it...
Why are you like this...
Why does this even have a name?
It says you've become his mole.
That's kind of a bad idea.
Give me a minute.
I got accusations against me.
I get... bad press.
Yeah... I'm not a bad press.
...
How do you feel about that?
About what?
About how you handled Rhode?
What do you think about it?
You think she's a good person?
I give you that.
...
You think she's a bad person?
She's a good person.
...
What about...
Are you nice?
I don't think so.
How do you feel?
You think I'm nice?
...
...
That's it?
That's it.
What was that?
An eraser.
What was that?
A replacement for the single head.
What was that?
A small coin slot.
There's a book in here. It's 'How to Clean Floors for Maroons' by Thes Pharoah.
Hello.
This is Thes Pharoah. He's a bit of a mystery to me.
What's up?
Just wanted to say that! I'm glad you reconsidered while you were at it.
I'm also... kind of stressed out.
You know... you should be thanking the gods.
Oh... Sorry. I didn't mean to.
Don't worry about
