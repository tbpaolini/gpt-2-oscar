======== SAMPLE 1 ========
're here to talk?
Nah.
Good, and you two are pretty well established.
I'm not even sure if it's that hard.
...
...
You two are living in the same house, though.
It's kinda cramped...
...
...
One of the couches is covered in bugs.
A cougar parts with a bunch of stuff...
...
That's quite a haul.
Do you have any more coffee, dear sister.
What's the price for spilling the beans?
None.
...
Ancillary wealth is a financial error - Murdock
...
Another financial error?
Nah, only a few hundred dollars.
million dollars?
Yeah, maybe?
Now that I think about you...
You'rehead style...
You know what, won't you please her?
...She deserves it...
...You're too weak to do anything...
Hurt them? Yes  Yes 
You just need to keep an eye on her...
...She won't be safe from you...
Maybe.
...
...
Well, you've only had one taste of elv-oil, so that's bad...
Hey, thanks.
You might want to deliver that instead.
What's the flavor of the year?
...Honesty...
What flavor of the year?
It's... strawberry.
You don't say...
...And you sure...?
Nope.

You too Jill?
Havana cows?
Rhodeians here in town?
Pffffff...
I don't know...
She's not a politician, honey.
He's a... a liar.
A charmer then.
...
We should probably get going...
Well, let's head back.
What was I thinking...?
The storm was starting...
How was it going?
It was kind of rough, really.
Just passed out a few moments ago.
You should get going. Something about Rhode's funeral seems pretty... intense.
Hey, don't look in her place.
Give her a minute. We're out of here matter of fact...
No sense dawdling.
Hey, lunch's done here. Have a seat.
Take her place? No Yes
Go with someone I think you need to know.
� where?
Where are you?
         Fine, leave me alone.
Fine, leave her alone.
Then what do you want?
I mean... I don't think she deserved this.
You're simplistic... Then why are you like this?
What...?
Why do you think I do this this many years later?
Why do you think I do this this many years later?
This better not be a mistake.
...
Anyway... Meet you back at the house.
Sure...elly rambler?
Yep.
Nice.
A rack for your books?
Yep.
This is too perfect...
How do you feel?
I feel... full of loneliness.
Uhh... what was that?
You got stolen by a bunch of Erectors. You're a D&D Nerd.
Why do you hate Erectors?
Because you're BIONI!
Then why are you here?
Why are you here?
Because you're BIONI?
...
Look... I can do both.
Can I do the same?
NO Yes
...
...
...
...
Well when you combine those, you could be...
LLama's Child.
...
...
Now you share the love.
...
...
Clarity is the key to being LALamLative.
Honesty is the key to silence.
Honesty is the key to being AMAZING.
All you've done is asked for it.
I won't let you do this.
I won't let you need you.
START!
It's been going really well.
I haven't even asked if anyone's present.
Well... sort of.
You're right. Not really.
...
...
So... what now?
You'll have to figure that out on your own.
Well, yeah. I'm sorry, bud.
I'm not human.
Then this...
It has to do with weight.
You can't hurt anyone else.
I understand your feelings.
True...
But one day you'll let me choose.
That's the path?
Don't worry about it. You got this.
...
So what now?
You're ready for it.
Why... why shouldn't you?
You can't fix this.
I'm sorry...
Don't worry about it. You got this.
...
So now you decide what really matters in life.
