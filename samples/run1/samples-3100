======== SAMPLE 1 ========
It's not like... you did anything special.
Yeah... I guess you're right. I just thought...
You were kind of chasing after weirdo ducks?
Not much of a chance there.
You were right... Sasquatch was chasing after a silly duck.
Yeah, that was funnier.
You again?
Yep.
This was pretty awkward considering how we were standing there.
You just kind of lost it. You really didn't need all that.
Hey kiddo, is everything going to be ok?
It's going to be ok. We don't need anything further than the surface.
Yeah... yeah... a little too much overhead.
You sure about that?
Yeah. We just got here so let's try not to mess around.
...
Anyway... See you tomorrow then.
SEPTEMBER FINE
<|endoftext|>This is the start of every horror movie I've ever been in.

Anyway... Something just sort of went wrong.
I don't know if it's... poisoning...

Quiet!
It's quiet again.
And much, much more quietly.
You're listening to music crusting the earth.
A strange, hauntingly beautiful play to music waste.
A young woman born doomed to loneliness.
An empty field and nowhere to sleep.
A circus figurine placed right next to the fountain.
Cousin Fardoll home at last.
A discarded light switch. All Fijians dream of it.
It's filled with cigarette butts.
A stick thrown out of the window.
It's empty.
They leave the butts over the hot dog.
It looks like someone's stolen it.
A rack of old photos.
You find a set of dusty shoes.
They look like they may have new glued back.
A set of bright red sunglasses.
You can't find any fresh lenses.
A bunch of scrapped music files.
A bunch of scrapped music files.
You found a bunch of trash.
Not your time up for sale.
Something nasty isfooting all over it.
This thing has a strange kind of edge.
Record the journey so far? No Yes
The gear page cuts out and you don't have to.
The journey is a bit rough around the eyes.
I'm glad you reconsidered.
So... what do you think the game's like now?
Maybe it wasn't so bad before...
Maybe it's different now.
This guy is all over the place. That's pretty terrifying.
Yeah... It's weird.
Yeah... It's weird.
You really can't be wrong.
What do you think the game would be like without him?
What is your take on the game?
What can you do?

...Good morning, Hoar Bracket.
A few workers have brought in over 300 items to perform keypad research. All of the research results have been assigned to each of the three workers. Please keep this table up for all of your research!
You're catching a lot of fish here. It's not like there's another on the market.
There's a ledger resting on a table. Strange symbols litter the pages.
Record the journey so far? No Yes
The ink sinks into the page and fades out. Your progress has been saved.
The thrum of ringing phones fills the air. You slowly nod your head to the sound, fighting back sleep.
Sleep on the job? No Yes
