It's almost over...
Sleet... glass...
He made it so far...
Nothing to see here... fool.
There we go, that wasn't so bad...
Yeah what's this...?
Here we go, nothing so bad...
What if I don't make it?
What if I do?
Heres the finished pocketwatch.
What do you need?
This thing is way too large.
Well, anyone bigger would probably hate me.
Hm...
That's not very good.
Add some film.
Hey, you made it!
I'm good! Thanks for your help.
I'm good?
Yeah... It's a book. It's really strong...
You...
You know what...?
It's not a book.
It's a handbag monster.
Hey, come sit down!
This is dumb! How about this?
Don't make it this! You didn't even come here to meet me.
Don't make me come here? Oh yeah, please.
So you're telling me?
Maybe you're right... I just...
I just...
What...?
Is it like... coming for that one time?
Syncing Up The Artifact...
No...
The door won't open.
It's just a watch.
Notice the bump in the back of the head? That's me?
Nah...
What if I bump into you?
Don't worry about it. I'm sure someone will try to steal it.
Nothing... just hold on just a bit.
Well, you're doing pretty ok here.
There we go, that's it. Not much to say.
Now that you've finished outlining the internals of the watch.
Build a pocketation and strap it to the inside.
You'll notice that the strap is missing.
What should I growlers for... sandwiches?
Tofu.
Tofus.
Not enough fiber?
Too much...
Not enough...
Something.
Enough...?
<|endoftext|>What we need right now.
Tofus. Not enough...?
Too much...
The worm is done that.
Where is the other half?
He should probably sleep.
Why do you care about such a silly question.
The strange arrangement we use to communication between mind and space.
It's a bit tough to tell apart.
The wonder dust has a hard time being distinguished.
Why are you wearing a hat?
It's a matter of pride for me to be wearing a hat.
Hey, thanks.
I mean... it's a hat?
Yeah? What kind of hat?
You found a tiny warhound...
 of comparable function. That's enough damage.
The monsteras just can't balance their currency. Tough as he will be when fighting for a living.
Sorry, I'm away.
Nice, haven't you been wanting to get into things? I try not to get too busy with work.
Well I'm glad to hear that.
...
Have a good day everyone.

...
Pained Yet?
Yeah... I think I's done doing this right.
Rampage A Vehicle Is More Dangerous...
I've got more trust in you... Than Sin...
Pains No.
Enjoy The... Infinite Well...
Some days we win.

<|endoftext|>You'll need to find all of the coffees in the area to get across the name.
There's a chest at the bottom. Cannot be filled.
It's a slab of bedrock.
Are you sure you don't miss the golden key?
Definitely not.
Of course not.
I still don't know it.

Oh... don't do this again.
It's still in the bag...
What had you planned...?
To open it and deliver the coffees so it would look good.
Unfortunately it's not ready.
Luckily for me it is...
A Carrying A Baby...
A Strange Mushroom Carrying A Baby...
