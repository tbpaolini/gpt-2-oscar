======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 something. You get it right?
Yeah. No need to say that. What could I have done differently?
Maybe you'd just gotten out of a life of crime?
Oh yeah. I mean... yeah. What was wrong with the plan?
It wasn't like you were going to survive. I mean, it definitely worked out fine, but... it just needed work.
Hey, maybe you didn't understand me right?
Uh, well... not really. I... didn't really realize until now.
You mean you can be mean?
Yeah? Well, you can be pretty mean. But you don't have to be. You're a good guy.
Seriously?
Why isn't someone like you around here working on stuff?
It's not a job for you to do. They're trying to be a manager instead.
...
What?
A manager?
Hang 'em! Don't be a jerk. Don't be a jerk. I don't give a fuck about you.
You really don't understand.
Well then, I guess I have some work to do.
There is work to do here. Where are you going?
I need someone to talk to.
Are you ready...
I'm outta here?!
...
Yeah... let's have a look.
A bunch of small things are missing right now.
What are the small things?
A bunch of small things. You... You're a monster.
GOD DAMN IT...
Yeah... maybe... I just forgot.
No... it's not my fault. No matter what.
I guess I'm the hero.
Wait... what?
He's a hero? What?
YOU CAME OUT OF A DANGEROUS ROOM.
I SAID IT WAS AN ARMOR.
...
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING...
What...?
HAILT YOU. YOU THINK YOU KID IT? DON'T WEAR IT?
You can't help but notice the things that are missing.
Don't be shy.
The forest here is quiet.
How can you say that to a forest in a forest?
It's quiet here, but you're not alone.
You can tell it's quiet here from the light in the trees.
I'm in luck because you are my hero.
...
You don't even have to be the hero.
You might just be!
Just take this as a compliment.
Look, I know you can't believe I even said this...
I don't know...
...
A bunch of things are missing right now.
...
What...?
I'm outta here?!
Yeah... maybe a manager?
Maybe. You'll need to ask yourself what he's doing here.
See ya in the forest!
You don't have to be the hero.
You won't get to choose who you love. Just know that it's me I choose to be with.
Don't worry about it. I love you and I miss you too.
Wait... you missed me.
There you are.
...
...
GOD DAMN IT...
...
...
Don't worry about it. I love you and I miss you too.
I'm not going to take the blame. Just trust me here.
I don't know if it's fair, but it's my responsibility to you. I'm sorry...
...
...
Wait...
Why did you do that to me?
...
...
You can't help but notice the things that are missing.
Don't be shy.
What...?
I CAN'T LEAVE YOU AROUND. YOU CAN'T GO OUT!
No you can't.
I am an animal.
It doesn't matter who's around.
It doesn't matter how close I am.
I AM AN ANGEL IN THE DARKNESS THAT WON'T STOP HIM.
That was a tough one. Keep going.
...
Don't be shy.
You're probably the worst person on this ship.
How dare you... tell me you love me.
Hey...
It's okay. It's not even on your computer.
How come? Seriously?
Why can't I say that?
You're not doing anything wrong.
See ya in the forest!
You know, he's a monster.
Just, you know, in the darkness?
He's a monster.
...
Wait...
You didn't even say anything.
No you didn't.
He's not real.
He's not real.
...
...
No...
It needs to be over.
You see?
What...?
That's no way.
It would take a lot more.
You know, it might.
You can't be that bad.
