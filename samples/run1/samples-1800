======== SAMPLE 1 ========
You'm right here.
...I...
Wait...
Aren't you supposed to be here?
Yes I do. I... I don't think so.
Why not me?
Why not me?
Why not me?
Why not me?
Why not me?
Why not me?
No... This is not your fault. Not me.
NOT MY FAULT! THIS IS MY CYCLE!
What... You're out to get me?
To fight for something?
These places are truly him.
I've come to the correct place then.
I'm not a fighter... This is about more than that
You know this.
You know what?
No... I really couldn't help but be drawn to this one.
The redheaded teen is in her forties this area but there's a big statue of Chahorare in here.
Oof...
Maybe you should start with the older sister?
Yes No
...
You know what... Fine.
You're right.
I'm glad you asked.
You know what...?
Yeah...
I wish I could fix that one bit more.
Good...
We can always fix that one bit more.
We can't always change the past.
You're right.
I'm glad you asked.
You know what...?
Yeah...
I wish we could go back to sleep more.
What?
You both are Noir.
Wait...
Are you ok?
Yeah, sorry...
That's fine...
Its fine...
You just...
You sure?
It's not...
Its fine?
No...
This is awkward...
It's friendship.
Not like I said, I'm a nerd.
Nope.
<|endoftext|>Onto the left...
There you go. That wasn't so bad.
There it is.
...
Last one left.
It's a bunch of brightly colored flower seeds.
What a cute little pod.
I only made one pod myself...
Well... One IcanLive. That's enough for now.
Ok... As you can see, the rest of the seeds aren't as tasty.
You can only take so many at a time.
You might want to a... Freefall.
Iowine...
That's it?
Yep.
You're second?
Uhh... uhh...
That's fine. I don't have much of a choice.
Make it three? Alright... I would.
Make it five? Alright...
What if I'm going to keep making these?
You're allowed to make any number of different kinds of plant based on your tastes.
What... you're not?
Iowine...
go back?
It's over?
Yeah... What have I done...?
You know what... Fine.
I'm sorry, lieutenant.
I...
I don't know what's on your mind.
I can help you...
What?
I want to do the perfect thing.
Excellent.
Alright, share this cup.
You can do what you like.
You can't...
Just want it.
Give it to me? Yes No
Alright so I know what I'm doing.
You're right. No.
 You're right.
Just give me what you want.
Just like before...
I want it.
Give me your need? Yes No
Cup is ready. Like new. How things are going.

Cup is ready. Like new. How things are going.
It's ready. I thought I would crash it... though, squish in your cycle potion?
It's not ready. Like new.
It's super cold out. Definitely not ready.
It's still full. That's very dangerous to think.
It's not ready. Like new.
They're setting out to take down a tower. Looks like they're doing pretty well.
They seem to be getting more and more into it.
It's not really a tower. Not yet.
It's getting pretty rowdy. It seems like the right moment.
Lots of rude text sending chum bark.
A very disarming environment.
There's a small inkpot in here. No more letters shaping up in here.
A very disarming environment.
The water cools before the start of the second part.
The forest surrounding them seems to be going away.
The air is pretty nice after a long day of work.
A caverat cafe is outfitted for something this rowdy.
A couple of saison sandwiches sit on the counter.
A few cold cuts sit well beneath the refreshing...
The apple pours out of the can into a neat brown bin.
