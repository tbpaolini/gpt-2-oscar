======== SAMPLE 1 ========

You know what? All of this makes me sad.
Really?
All of this doesn't feel right.
It's just... lacking in purpose.
Well, that's the problem with bad intentions.
When you ask me, I tell you what... It's just not enough.
...
Well... you're right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.


PHOENIX AND MIGHTYYYYY COURSE AGAIN
Uhh... what's wrong?
Uhhh...
Don't worry... it's not real...
I got stuff on me
Uhh...
Hey! Come out to dinner!
OH...!!!
I SEE IT.
What...?
Put on your best buddy!
MEOW!!!
So you did it.
You did it twice already!
So you did it once, right?
Yeah.
So now you're the new guy guy?
NO! I'm not that guy.
I got it.
WHAT?!
Uh... what?
Get over here. I need something.
Alright, fine.
Get out of my way.
Sorry... I didn't mean to offend anyone.
Don't need to learn anything new.
...
What about us...?
Wait... what?
People who live here.
Living here means... well, you know... dead.
Are you not scared of living?
No... I just... just don't know anything about living.
I just... don't know anything about living.
You mean living you know?
Yeah.
Do you mean living yourself?
Yes.
But like me?
No...
So like them.
So you do nothing.
You really are like me...
That's just my self.
I mean... that's just the way it is.
Well then... what do you know?
Lots of stuff like that.

You really are like me...

I'm talking about Lemuel the laborer.
...
Wait... what?
His fur is likelier to get ribs than a mole.
What?
He's a laborer's animal.
Like, really freakish after the fact.
...
Anyway...
If you want to work with me you have to work with me...
First I have to work with you.
No, I'm not a terrible person.
Just try not to say anything about his fur.
Anyway...
Fine.
With me?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Nice. I'll let you know if I'm anywhere from Rto's List to work with.
Ack... wham...
Wait... wham...?
Whole time you're just playing with me?
I don't feel good.
I don't move a muscle.
Yeah... wham...?
What happened to the monkey quarters?
To my mind.
What did you just do?
To my mind.
What...?
Ack... wham...?
Yeah... wham...?
What's wrong with shy people?
Inappropriate touching. Abusive treatment.
Tired... resting.
Restless... testing the fitness of others.
Unresponsive... catching a cold.
Feeling sorry for him...?
It's just a sock.
You're thinking about how touching someone's form won't help them or help you feel when you need help.
Now imagine being touched and scared.
This way of thinking results in a less sensitive and capable being.
Pierc is a terrible friend because they protect against all forms of fear.
Pierc is also very cold sensitive and won't let you in on a secret.
Don't worry, you'll be fine.
It's a long story.
You're in my final moments...
You even leave a heart shaped key.
The key is worthless and needs to be opened up.
Opening it would take hundreds of needles.
A fine thought... but the thought doesn't end.
The world fades away as you leave, either alone or with your beloved.
<|endoftext|>Time to get out of here...
Maybe I'm an ant...
Feed Baron... fast...
Time to figure it all out... right?
How about... farm... parenthood...
He earned it... fast.
This piece of land isn't his... yet.
He needs to be fed... and can be found.
All that work, farm, and a nice head? You're getting me out of here.
Just farm whatever works for you.
What? All that work, food, and work? I just don't see any evidence to support those claims.
What? All that work, work?
He paid for it... right?
No. I'm a big Oob!
That's pretty rad, intern.
You're making sense.
