 down the windowsill and onto the kitchen counter to steal something.
Oh...
It's very faint. You will need to move the lightbulb on the other side of the counter to get it.
No need to get so lost. Something will need to be found.
No...
You will need to stay on the edge of consciousness to look at it.
Look... it's a picture. Something that clarifies what happened.
That does not mean your side is correct.
I am not an archangel or anything.
...
Just to name a few...
...They exist...
...Destroy them all...
<|endoftext|>...NO!!!
This must be the guy. The one who left you feeling down. I told you he was not for he was strong...
...He will fall...
...You are almost there...
...Feel free to fall...
<|endoftext|>Look at him... Look at him.
He is very powerful. I saw it...
It was made out of power. It can't be trusted to keep this away.
I'm keeping it...
...Look at him... Look at him.
You are not alone.
Not even me.
...
I'm sure you are too...

YOU ARE SAD!!!
It can be hard to see into.
It is not real...
I can make it look it's not real...
...You sure about that...
...Don't worry about it...
I'm here to help you...
I can fix this...
Don't give up...
I am on my last breath...
I am almost there...
...You can do it...
...You're too good to look...
...But not always...
...Come here...
I can help...
I only do this...
...You weren't there...
I don't know if I could...
...But you did...
<|endoftext|>...Look...
You...
Are you ok?
...You thought you could talk?
...But I don't have the strength...
...If you did...
...What kind of person you are...
...I wouldn't want to stay...
...Leaving...
What...
 Are you ok...?
...You looked like you were going to give...
...AICAN...
 What are you talking about?
...They were looking for...
...Ailar...
...They murdered her parents...
...You're wrong...
...They're not my friends...
...They're Baxter...
...You're wrong...
<|endoftext|>...Look...
You...
Are you ok?
...Yeah...
I didn't expect this from you...
...But You...
...You're wrong...
...But I don't want to...
...You're looking...
...angry...
...You're kidding...
...But a funeral home worker looks...

...Such a low asking price...

...I expect nothing less...
...You're right...
...But you're wrong...
...But I don't want to...
...Leaving...
What...?
...She left too...
...She's not my sister...
...But a funeral home worker looks...
...Such a low asking price...
...I expect nothing less...
...You're right...
...But do it...
...You're right...
...But don't say you didn't pay...
...I give you my full price in full...
<|endoftext|>...How can I help you?
...Nope.
...Fine...
...Show me how.

<|endoftext|>Hey kid, can you borrow a thing like that?
No
I wonder what you're looking at there.
Irony!
What do you mean?
I mean...
You have this.
Something you can use.
I mean...
You don't know what I'm talking about.
Maybe I'm mistaken...
I could be wrong...
I just can't think things over.
You know what?
No worries.
Good luck, kid.
Hang in there, you're due here.
Thanks.
