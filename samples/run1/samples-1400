Yes. Now you're fired.
That's pretty nasty, Intern.
Yeah, I get it. Don't do it again.
...
...
... But...
  He deserved that.
Yeah...
Some things don't make other things.
Don't worry about them.
For now...
You're done for. Just... know in time.
I don't have any more trouble.
Do you really think I can't fight back?
Well, that's very different to having a mole on the order of length and strength?
Considering how things went down...
You wouldn't want that.
You're right... I'm pretty tough then.
I don't have much of a memory.
You really just had my word.
I wonder if you would agree that the same can't-do-this kind of happened to someone as honorable as yourself?
Well... I would be a bit more selective.
You're wrong.
Actually... you would be a lot less selective.
Of course I would. You did a good job of it.
Just... what...?
You left a trail of doubt and doubt.
At the very least, you brought it to light.
Trapped trying to contact hero...
Reading a response by a hero whose fate we don't yet know.
What a fantastic memory!
You missed a few pages due to... memory fatigue.
I expected from you...
You didn't expect from me.
Thanks...
You almost made it, Intern.
You were waiting for someone else...
I didn't expect your skill with an axe to hone itself.
What an axe skill, Intern.
Your mastery of the axe enables you to sever trees with ease.
I highly suggest you undertake this challenge, though, as my choice for obstacles on which to counter my will.
Though admittedly rather handy.
Nodding an axe to me grants you an extensive neural network of my thoughts.

Just waiting to be instructed.
My neural network perfectly matches your wishes.
The network and the decisions it makes are mind blowing.

<|endoftext|>Neat ya.
Well, this is it.
Thanks for everything.
You're almost there. Keep going.

This screen is haunting.
Sleepwalking while smarmy.
Definitely getting better.
This plant is pretty quick with pocket computers.
Definitely getting faster.
One hidden shelf.
There's a password to that.
A pretty sight for a pocket computer.
A password that won't satiate my pocketwatch.
A terrifying bunch of plants growing in the sand.
Not all passwords come with a price.
You can get most, if not all of them.
All of them?
No?
Well, what's the catch?
Hah, you're in for a treat.
HOLY HOT HECKIN' SHIT!
Seriously?
Your first crack at a greenhouse.
You're a planet worker?
in a greenhouse? GOOD QUEST HEARD.
Seriously?
You found a redactor of a password.
I'M READY TO REJOIN OUR CAMPAIGN.
I QUICK KNOW TO STRENGTH, DOW HO!
Hang in there! I. I don't mean!
Go figure.
First row on the right.
I WON'T CLOSE MY GASP MINK FOR BACK IN THE MINI MESA TIME OUT
That's a ROUTE IN WATERFUCKING.
The screen is dark and unresponsive.
Second row on the right.
It's jammed full of paperwork.
Why are you down here...?
This thing is malleable.
It won't open until you punch it.
That's a punch!
Second row on the right.
It's jammed full of documents.
