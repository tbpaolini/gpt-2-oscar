Good good.
...Poor old Joe...
...Poor old Joe...
<|endoftext|>On the job right now...
Rest in dark place for an hour.
Sounds good.
Do the floor for the birds.
Nice. Pizza palace.
Well, that's not very nice.
Nice. Pizza palace. Crisp and full of personality.
Nice. Nurturing none of the other flowers.
A fine flower.
Not a flower.
A flower that does not have a spark.
A flower that does.
A lovely pink flower.
Not a flower.
A lovely pink flower. Home.
A humble plant. Flowers stand up for the underdog.
A humble plant. Flowers stand up for the hero.
A humble plant. You're toast. The systems managed to snag the vital data.
A humble plant! Delicious!
You're covered in dirt and knocked to the ground. Your feet are unresponsive.
You're covered in tears and barely have a scratch on your right hand.
You're doing fantastic work at work. Unfortunately you're notetaking the other party is slain by your...
That's not very funny...
That's not very funny...
<|endoftext|>Hey!
I know you're in the middle of playing this game right now.
Unfortunately we're not using a high priority memory so we fail to deliver on the high call.
Unfortunately Fern is offline and you do not know it.
I would highly recommended you to other players on your performance levels.
The game is still in full swing having finished it 4:0 despite the fact we are all gamers.
That's probably too little for two people, huh?
Good choice Joe.
The receiver clicks into place.
<|endoftext|>The device seems ready.
A familiar book set on you.
It's excerpt is starting to read too quickly.
It says 'Performance Monitor'. What a neat little power user!
Who... you are...?
Hold up The Tower for a bit. It's time to clean it up.
<|endoftext|>... Awful things can happen when you don't listen.
A fresh start for thoughtless rumination.
The stuttering creature is ready with a depth of field.
Present or not, I've got your back.
FUZZY HOI*
That's none of your fault...
...You're weak...
Enough that you take my axe?
Uhh... no, bud.
Dude...
You're right... I'm not your enemy.
What...?
Give it a shot.
Why should I give you shit? I'm not his hostage.
You're being petty, dude.
Give it a shot.
I'm the better manager. Money gives ya.
Give it a shot.
I don't think I can do this alone.
Damn...
Sick job doing the odd security clearance.
Yeah security clearance.
Newhire huh?
You must be bit either way.
Don't worry bud. Some things don't have to be said.
You're only paying for length and space right now.
I'll see you on the other side.
Wait... thick as nails?
Yeah me neither.
I'm not even mad.
You look tired to me.
Sick job...
Sick job...
You think I'm going to give you a shot?
I don't know...
...
Well I don't really know you.
...
You're a poacher...
You take the quick shot.
I'm taking the heat away from you like never before.
Yeah that'sfright...
You quickly pick up the weapon.
...
Looks like the heat is off...
...
You took the chance on my thrills.
That's... not what happened.
I knew I could become a good actor.
That's all I really knew at the time.
So that was the plan?
Yeah... to go get me a drink.
...
...
Seriously just sit here thinking about the problem for a while?
Is this it?
No...
...
... ...
...
Better just forget about the problem.
Nope!
...
...
...
Great... but, I'm not a good at this kind of thing.
Don't worry about it.
...
...
That's it...
That was kind of the problem.
Well... You've got one problem.
What...?
Don't worry about it.
...
...
That's it...
That was just a scarecicle.
So... what now?
Just chill for a bit.
Then resume your next move.
That's kind of rough...
That's kinda why I'm here.
You earned it
