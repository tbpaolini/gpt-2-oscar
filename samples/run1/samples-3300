======== SAMPLE 1 ========

So let me give you a little push.
The handle will lock and you won't see me.
That's ok.
If you need help just talk to the ghost.
I mean... actually doing something am I brave enough to do?
You're kind of scaring me... Is everything ok?
Yeah... Sorry?
I mean... actually doing something am I brave enough to do?
...You're scaring me...
...But what if?
Well I mean... actually doing something am I am...
...But you're not scaring you...
...I mean... actually doing anything am I...?
...But my mind is racing...
I'll try...
Just don't give up.
...But don't give up...
...But... it... feels... real...
You're hurting me...
You're holding me tightly...
...But you're holding me even more...
...But you're holding me even more...
...But but... it... feels... real...
...But... it... feels... real...
...But...... it... feels... real...
...But...... it... feels... real...
...But...... it... feels... real...
...But...... it... feels... real...
...It's called skill...
...It's called skill...
...You'll need this basket...
... It looks like a Brand New Car...
...It's a great size for a minute at a time mistake...
...It's a brand new car...
...Its going to be a busy one
...Filled with all the missing photos...
...Why don't you send me the book?...
...It's called 'The Sun Is Going toNever Come'....
...It's covered in photos of the day...
...The basket is full of what appear to be heartbroken notes...
...We don't have all day...
...Thank you for your honesty...
...It's time to get back to the kitchen...
...The bookcase is too small...
...The rack is too heavy...
...The mixer too strong...
...The flash hider too large...
...The backlit setting is too bright...
...You can't hear the cast from it...
...The computer too is overloaded...
...The only light is the cast from it...
...The backlit setting is too dark...
...You don't have any lighted potions left...

...Bottling with Fire...
...The cast evaporates in a flash of light...
...The only liquid on the cast is a Stripe Sash...

I Need Your Help!
The device is in its final stages of maintenance. There is a book in the cartouches of the unfortunate.
The spine of the book says it's Fromres. Back then it helped people find adventures in the forest.
The twin stones on the other side of the stone help lift it up.
Anvil Top
It is cold out and won't let you in.
Uhh... welcome to Atal'T 'Time?
Do you really want to bow down and die?
I mean... yeah. But only if you prove me wrong.
Cafeteria Worker
Well that's not very helpful.
Anvil Top
...
There's a ledger resting on a table. It says... 'You're Fired.'
The worker is holding out a paw and a pen. The ink sinks into the machine.
It's full of many more books.
The faint smell of coffee wafts through the air.
The faintest hint of flower on the page.
The machine stops and ducks into a back pocket.
You're gonna need this thing to my house.
I don't know if I can handle it.
There's a ledger resting on a shelf. It's time for a job.
The boring job of keeping an eye on Animus and/'t here on Golarion.
The drawer is damaged and nobody seems to be getting in.
The Animus doesn't appear to be using his home or anything.
It seems to be running out of materials to mail.
It seems to be having a hard time sorting it.
It seems to be getting more and more tired.
It seems to be mostly covered in tedious paperwork.
ID Chomper
The label says it all. Please understand that I do my best...
The job description says leave no stone unturned.
With no time to waste the BoRTS world is collapsing on you.
There's a familiar book set on the table.
Record the journey so far? No Yes
The ink sinks into the page and fades out. Your progress has been saved.
The thrashing around in a nametag feels like you've taken something away.
The machine seems to have worn
