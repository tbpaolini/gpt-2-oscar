======== SAMPLE 1 ========

We will.
...
Alright...
You're weak...
Don't give up...
What are you doing...?
I have so much promise in this world.
What...?
In the blink of an eye, did you!
WITH WHOM WE WILL?
No...
Then I have no opinion...
Just... give me your time.
Well then...
Binder...
Yes Binder...
What are you doing...?
I... I don't know...
What...?
With you we go...
I will!
What...?
With you we go...
Then we can go one day...
You poor thing...
Why would I...
Then you're weak...
<|endoftext|>Will it be worth it?
I mean... maybe...
You...
Maybe?
Yeah...
...
Get over here already...
Loading...
CHEAT CHANGELUDE!!!
How about...
That's her new uniform...
That... isn't what...
What does her new outfit do?
It... does nothing.
It's just an old, striped blazer.
It's too dusty to see anything.
Maybe a little warm thought...
...It was just a busy blimp...
...It never left...
...It just settled...
...Wake up Useless...
...You're blind...
...You'll never see it...
...Horrible nightmare...
...This is it...
...Burn the book...
...It's really pasty...
...Wild animals...
...Notation by the way...
...No lies...
... just superstition...
...Patron Hive paranoia...
A DEEP SUN IS AMONG ALAs... A SMALL THING...
...WAS MY BEST STRUGGLING EVER AWAKENING...
A MONSTER BREAK TIGHT!
<|endoftext|>It's a snake.
...
Not the best acronym for bank robber.
Is it really a spider?
Nah.
Is it a spider at all?
I wonder...
Its name?
Treasure.
Is it a name for a sock?
RUN!
You're sure to find a familiar one?
I STRONGLY MAKE SURE NOT TO CONTACT HER, OTHERS!
...
I'm sure she'll be fine.
So... what do I have to do?
Go find a new one of yours.
Make my task...
Good! First, find a new one of yours.
Second, find a new one of mine.
Alright, that's it.
Thanks...
You did it... The task has now been filled.
Alright, that's it...
Your task, Intern. You fill empty roles here at the Bitfinex.
My pleasure...
That was fun of you.
Any questions, Intern.
Thanks...
<|endoftext|>This job is pretty... bad.
I just don't get... when to send a response, or when the light at the end of the tunnel is on.
That's not very helpful, Intern.
Thanks for your time, though. I'm sure we can work through this.
I don't have much time left.
What are you waiting for yourself, Intern.
Good thing you found the snakey red one.
Looks like ittaboola-0lly.
You wonder what it would be like to... bite.
You would be wise to Murdock immediately.
Good thing you found the snakey red one.
You think it's too cool to talk?
I feel bad for you, Intern. You found him!
Nope.
What was that?
Something too elaborate.
I won't say anything.
Good, we can talk.
Can't be you or Joe here.
I won't say anything either way.
It's too blustery to the neighbors.
Oh, don't say I didn't warn ya.
I warn ya only...
...
You're too clever to disobey.
What...?
I can stop you all.
Just need to know you have considerable wit and empathy for others.
Does that mean I have to live up to your name?
Nope.
Alright...
Does that mean I have to live up to your name?
You're lazy actually.
No problem√±atires.
Hey, thanks a'ides.
I didn't expect you'd be so quick with these.
...
...
You just kind of nod your head when I tell myself...
Just so ya feel better.
...
Thanks...?
This isn't right... It's not real...
...Burne...
...
You...
Feed him the Waffle first? No Yes
