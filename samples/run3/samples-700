======== SAMPLE 1 ========

And so for all you adventurers out there!
I just finished up my regular routine of Dungeon Crawls! Seriously, get yourself ready for some pretty ridiculous nonsense!
I'm really not a programmer, really, you know!
Oh and thanks for playing! The more gold you have, the fatter the game gets!
Seriously, you know nothing enough to make an idiotic mistake!
Hey... that's pretty rad.
Also... you can't ride unicorns.
Yeah... I know that sounds ridiculous but your kind of for you to decide.
Also... what do ya spellin? I mean... what sound like?
Seriously?
You say?
Yeah.
How do you spell that?
Try 'T' for yourself.
For a few brief seconds, I felt the calm air.
Then I felt the ground.
Then I felt nothing.
You heard that?
Yeah.
Who made you this way...?
... I don't know what you intended.
You could've just asked...
... For what?
I just wanted to say something and feel it.
Something other than that...
You're pathetic.
You can't be serious.
You're pathetic.
I'LL MAKE SURE OF IT!
Only ONE FAULT!
THE OTHER WILL MAKE ME MAKE THREAT ASTROLY INCEPT!
Hah... That's pretty grim.
Your next choice is... right?
Keep itlll...
THE OTHER WILL MAKE ME MAKE THREAT AMAZING IN THE TOWER.
Your next choice is...
That's kind of brutal.
Your next choice is...
That girl in the middle isn't a monster.
She's just like you.
I AM AMOR!
Finally...
It's settled. Your next one is... right?
You either love her or you don't.
You're both garbage.
Then...
It's... too hard.
You know what... I'll try.
I guess you will.
You can't change the past.
You can only survive the future.
I WIN!
You're in for a bad old fashioned threesome.
The pun isn't gross either.
You are disgusting...
You are disgusting...
You have no fear of the unknown.
I WIN!
You masturbate like a cowboy while listening to music.
Your sound is like a storm falling over your valley.
Natural music plays through the night.
You're not there yet...
You really can't be there.
Maybe by listening to more of what nature has to offer we can improve.
That's all it really is.
What is this?
Nothing.
Couldn't really stand up to that.
Hey Binder!
Where are you going?
Go with the flow.
You're in for a rude awakening.
Sit back and relax.
The only important action is...
Hang In There.
The screen is dark and unresponsive.
I need to borrow a coffee break before you head to work.
You're telling me you can't drive!
Hrm... That may sound reasonable, but... actually needing to borrow a car isn't that unusual.
Yeah... I could always take you to a drive in a while.
That would be simple.
Wiener...
Hee hee...
Fern...?
GEORGE Well hey, don't look so silly.
You'll need to bring along a bit of hydration though.
Yep, that up front.
Don't worry about it.
That's life. Phoen
Thanks for your time, Pebbles.
RUN No more recapping my recaps. --Graeme MINI-FUCKER!
That was just my luck. He went to the pool in need of hydration.
Wait... how is that a skill? BRUCE!
Yeah, maybe not the best way to look at it, but he was definitely hydrated.
Looks like him recapping is a skill!
Yeah... I guess my own mistake had been?
In need of another? NOPE!!!
Yep You bounced back pretty well.
Did you, er, steal the batteries?
No... not really.
You sure? You going to have to earn your stripes.
Yup... I got my lights module set to medium intensity.
That looks like it to me. How rough it is.
Who made you this rough?
You and I got going on a merry-go-round. Don't worry though, I need to get to Newhire Joe.
JOB THING Alrighty then. I'm heading over to your place.
We need to get a handle on some of the finer points of your business. Something for a drink?
We need to talk about something. You don't
