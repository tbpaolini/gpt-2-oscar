He hurt you again.
Hurt him back.
How do you feel? He didn't mean to. Hurt him.
You don't know what you're talking about.
I do.
You just can't see it yet.
Maybe you're right...
You'll get your chance.
Keep going.
She meant to hurt you.
We don't need her.
You hurt her first. I did... She deserved it.
Just... stop...
You're blind.
You'll see in time.
She doesn't matter.
You can see it now.
You know the truth.
They all did...
It's a moist sock! Gross...
The wind plays through the trees as leaves fall around you.
Record the journey so far? No Yes
The ink sinks into the page and fades out. Your progress has been saved.
It's nice here... quiet.
Rest on the forest floor? No Yes
Look to the past.
Look to the future.
Another toy in my domain?
You will fall with the others.
Crushed by the molten fist of a true warrior!
BURN BRIGHT BURN OUT
A broken home.
Breaks all hearts.
Grumbling Turtle Noises
Is that grumbling I hear?
Of course not.
Sounds like it to me.
Everything sounds like grumbling to you.
Maybe because you're always grumbling.
Maybe there's a reason for that.
Maybe you're the reason.
Maybe you're both the reason...
NOBODY ASKED YOU!!!
Hey now... Where do you think you're going?
I could say the same to you.
Oh yeah?
.........................
JUST STOP ALREADY!!!
NOBODY ASKED YOU!!!
Dude, seriously.
You're just playing with me.
I don't care what you are.
I will protect you from the outside.
That's it...?
See you soon.
With that settled.
I guess I'll be along for the ride.
So... how do you know my name?
I've lived this way my whole life.
You know what? Sure.
It's my twin. To be honest with you... I'm kind of a maroon.
Oh... sorry.
Don't worry about it. You got this.
I'm just telling you.
The name is yours.
I SAID SURE YOU MAKE TIME FOR IT
That's it?
That supertextually terrifying.
Alright... I guess I can do that.
Good. I'll be attending to... then.
Alright... I guess I can do that.
An obnoxious bunch.
Not all obnoxious...
You're not listening to what you're doing.
I'm the BOSS!
NO SADNESS!
I'm the boss!
I win.
How do you know I'm not supposed to be here?
I came to help you.
I heard that.
It's not real...
You can't be serious.
Oh yeah...
You thought you could see it?
You got this.
Hey, I can see it now.
What do you think about this kid?
He looks like he's going to give it his best.
Else he's just going to freak out.
You can't test that thought.
You're right.
Another toy.
Another insult.
Another broken bargain.
How do you know I'm not supposed to be here?
I can't be working on this...
I don't even know what's wrong with me.
This is your fault.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
Enough.
Is the light sensitivity as strong as yours?
It's just a dream...
You can't be serious.
It's your fault.
It's your fault.
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
Oh boy...
So many questions.
I get so much information from this device.
It's my fault if I don't deliver.
How do I know?
That's the question...
What is this?
It's a pocketwatch. So I made a pocketwatch.
Sounds good.
Is this how I want it?
Yeah...
This is...
It's not real...
You can't be serious.
It's your fault
