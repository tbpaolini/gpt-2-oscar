 is a lot.
You make a great viking yaknow.
Thanks! You make a decent one yourself.
Just decent?
Alright you make a great viking.
Haha, that's much better.
The garbage beast of legend was slain here by two brave vikings.
So you do know where garbage is supposed to go after all...
It's filled with garbage.
The Viking Feast pours from the can into the trashcan. A tiny axe shaped meat clings to the side of the bin.
Why would you do that...? Has it really gotten that bad?
This isn't like you... It can't be...
The Viking Feast brand dog food sits gloomily at the bottom of the trashcan.
Denied its destiny the trashcan recoils in sadness.
Hey Lore?
Yeah what's up?
Just wanted to say... I had a really good time today.
Yeah me too. Let's head back to bed, alright?
Sounds good buddy.
Hey Lore?
Yeah what's up?
Today seemed kind of off... Is everything alright?
Yeah... Sorry for being a maroon...
That's alright... We can both be maroons sometimes. Let's get back to bed, ok?
Hey Lore?
Yes?
You're kind of scaring me... Is everything ok?
Of course. Why do you ask?
N... no reason...
Take the axe? Yes No
Getting ready for a Viking LARP? I won't judge you...
Strike fear into the hearts of trees and terrors alike.
Baron's Collar...
He must be close by...
Don't worry buddy... I'm on my way...
It's torn to shreds... Blood for blood...
It's torn to shreds...  
You found a wet sock. Slimy!
Finally paying attention are we?
Took you long enough...
Just a few mistakes here and there.
Nobody will notice... right?
Leaving just one flower...
You're pretty messed up. You know that right?
You just can't help yourself...
What an animal.
Cat got your tongue?
I... don't know what to say.
Well, that didn't stop you before.
What do you mean?
You really wanted to dig... didn't ya?
You barely knew her.
What are you talking about?
Rhode, ya dingus.
You never talked to her.
Yet you still tried to give me advice.
Well... yeah I guess.
Why?
Why did you give Fern advice? I wanted to help. I wanted to know more.
Wait... really?
Yeah...
I wasn't trying to be a maroon. Sorry if it came across that way.
Huh... that kinda changes things.
Seriously...?
Yeah...
You do realize how messed up that is right?
I mean... maybe?
You're wrong.
What...?
I talked to her before we went to lunch.
She clearly likes you.
Liked...
What...?
Where we are.
We can beat this and be friends again.
No...
This is just a trick...
It has to be...
You didn't catch a single one?
Nope.
What if I'm going to buy it?
Yeah... it's too risky.
Why not?
What if you're going to buy it?
Yeah... it'll be risky.
Are you sure you don't need any help?
One minute you're in control. The next you're not.
Do you know how to door?
No...
Do you?
Yes... we're just doing our job.
Alright... hand me the watch and lets get going.
I'm ready?
Well... first thing.
Open the chest.
There's a... salamander bloodied and scaly... This is bad...
It'sine... So itchy... Wait... Blood for Bark?
It's covered in sticky notes. Blood seems to linger for a minute.
The bird sounds like it should.
Do you know where the blood is?
Nope.
Nice.
Looks like Fern is able to fix her teeth.
Wait... what?
You're not supposed to be like this.
I am though!
We're in the middle of fixing our pallets, kid.
Nice.
You're not supposed to be like that.
I... what?
Oh yeah?
Keep going.
She seems pretty ok.
Finally fixed their... thing.
You're not supposed to be that way.
I'm glad you turned things around.
It's not too late to turn things back.
Things are looking up for our brave adventurers.
