======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 luck the light.
Wake up Lore.
Wake up and prove yourself.
I thought it happened differently...
Maybe I was wrong...
You're wrong.
I know better than to take what isn't mine.
I hope you learn the same lesson one day.
You're wrong.
I stole it.
It's not something I'm proud of. I'm working on myself and it's hard sometimes.
I'm glad you see things my way.
What did you just say to me?
Obedient... and loving.
Even so... you've got a mean streak in you.
Despite your hurtful words... I still have hope for you.
You're always fighting back. Always... hurting.
You killed him.
You murdered your best friend.
Just like you murdered your father.
In his final moments. You let him live.
You care so much for Baron.
Such a compassionate child.
That never happened.
So you did it.
You actually finished him.
Hope it felt good.
Enjoy this moment.
Even in his final moments.
You were too weak.
But don't worry.
It will be over soon.
Just leave me alone...
Or what?.
Or... Nothing I guess...
It's almost time anyway.
Time for what...?
The Tower.
Crushed Souls.
Don't Forget.
You're Here Forever.
Well done.
You didn't need him.
He was useless.
Now he's gone.
I SAID SHUT UP!!!
YOU DON'T KNOW HIM!!!
And now.
Neither will anyone else.
What...
No...
It was just a fight...
He's at the office...
I'm sure you'll.
Figure it out.
Disgusting.
These attachments.
They only.
Weigh you down.
It doesn't matter either way.
You can't change what happened.
You're right.
But will it last?.
You're only going to.
Hurt them.
In the end.
Shut up...
No.
I don't think I will.
Animus.
Twisted.
Trapped.
Lost Souls.
Muspelheim.
Iron and Fire.
Burning Passion.
A Broken Home.
Niflheim.
Steel and Frost.
A Stone Heart.
A Broken Home.
You're always doing this.
Doing what exactly?
Coddling him... he's never going to grow up this way.
Sitting on the couch wasting time with that... thing.
He's fine. One day he'll be too old to laze his summers away. Let him enjoy himself.
He's going to be just like you at this rate.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means you're weak.
You've always been weak.
Even now you don't have the strength to stand up for yourself.
Pathetic.
You can't change this.
You don't have the strength.
Just give up.
Just give in.
You wanted this.
You chose this.
Forget this place.
Forget yourself.
Hey kid, wanna see a magic trick?
Well do you? Yes No. I hate fun.
You know what? Sure.
Sick, check this out.
FUZZY PICKLES!!!
Well that was definitely... magical.
Nah.
You're boring.
Nah.
He hurt you again.
Hurt him back.
How do you feel? He didn't mean to. Hurt him.
You don't know what you're talking about.
I do.
You just can't see it yet.
Maybe you're right...
You'll get your chance.
Keep going.
She meant to hurt you.
We don't need her.
You hurt her first. I did... She deserved it.
Just... stop...
You're blind.
You'll see in time.
She doesn't matter.
You can see it now.
You know the truth.
They all did...
It's a moist sock! Gross...
The wind plays through the trees as leaves fall around you.
Record the journey so far? No Yes
The ink sinks into the page and fades out. Your progress has been saved.
It's nice here... quiet.
Rest on the forest floor? No Yes
Look to the past.
Look to the future.
Another toy in my domain?
You will fall with the others.
Crushed by the molten fist of a true warrior!
BURN BRIGHT BURN OUT
A broken home.
Breaks all hearts.
Grumbling Turtle Noises
Is that grumbling I hear
