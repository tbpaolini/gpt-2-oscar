Some loose folders with scraps of paper strewn about.
A single sticky note is glued to the shelf...

Small multi-colored papers litter the board. The words seem to shift as you try to read them.
A sock note is pinned to the board. Informative!
The handle rattles but the door remains unmoved.
A small keypad is stuck to the desk.
Where... Where am I...?
