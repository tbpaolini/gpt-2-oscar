======== SAMPLE 1 ========
.
An ideal unknown to us.
The thought has appeal.
You overstep, dear brother.
My apologies, dear sister.
You know what? Fine.
I'm sick of you wasting my time.
Hurt them.
Make them pay.
Make them pay? You don't have to do this. Don't let it control you.
Make them pay? Yes  Yes 
It is denying the influence.
This vessel holds promise.
A foolish mistake.
This vessel is not ready.
Shall we test it?
In time.
Until then...
Farewell, little one.
You will understand when it's over. This is for the best.
That will not happen. Not now not yet.
We can fix this.
Well that's about the best I can do fer now.
Is he gonna be ok?
Well, it'd take a miracle. Thankfully I'm a miracle worker.
A modest miracle worker no less!
Quiet you.
Hehe...
... Look he's moving!
Told ya! Miracle worker.
No... No please... I can't do this... I can't fight you...
Oh calm down ya big baby. Yer safe here in my house. The names Cirsi!
And I'm Ramul. We can totally be friends and stuff!
You're late for work, kiddo. Mail ain't gonna deliver itself.
OH!!! I GOTTA RUN SEEYA GREENFRIEND!
OH!!! I GOTTA RUN SEEYA STRIPEFRIEND!
Anyhow... Welcome to Animus... Whatever ya are!
I gotta get back to work... Feel free to get yer footing before ya head out.
Talking animals... I've finally lost it.
You know what, whatever. At least they seem friendly.
Many strange objects wiggle in the muck.
Ok, that is nasty.
It's full of hypnotic wiggling nastiness.
There's an inscription at the bottom. 'Hang in there, ya big baby.' -Cirsi Thistle
One of them is covered in brown slime. Gross!
Make the bed? No Yes
Better leave it for someone else.
There we go! Much better.
Nice and neat.
A circular iron lock bars your way. Muffled music plays through the door.
A tough chain and a diamond shaped lock hold this chest closed tightly.
The perky plant wiggles as you reach for it.
It's a painting of a forest in autumn.
The forest surrounding Animus is so nice this time of year.
Sleep until nightfall? No Yes
Sleep until daybreak? No Yes
There's still too much to do.
The dream washes over you like wind through the trees.
Do Not Trust Them
Wait...
Where am I...?
Boo!
WHARRGARBL!!!
Nice, hazing the intern is going to be easier than I thought.
What are you talking about? I'm not an intern.
You're a new employee of Tower Corp. Welcome to the club bucko.
I don't work here. Leave me alone.
Look kid, I know you don't belong here.
Obviously!
Keep it down... Just play the part for now, got it?
Alright... I guess I can do that.
That's my intern! Now meet me in the boardroom at once!
Third row on the right. Can't miss it.
Got it.
Also, don't bump into... anything.
The birds are still out on the floor and they don't take kindly to new faces.
Catch ya soon.
Hey, I'm OScar! Beep. Boop.

Access granted. Newhire sorting will now begin.
Sorting...?

Newhire has failed initial testing procedures. Smartliness is clearly lacking.
Newhire has achieved excellence in smarts. Well done, Newhire.
Yeah well, that's just your opinion, man.
Dude, nice.
Performance Category: Speederosity
Newhire is extremely slow under pressure. Newhire may be a tortoise.
