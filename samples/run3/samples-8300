======== SAMPLE 1 ========

I'm ready! What's going on...?
Wait... This doesn't make any sense...
You are perceiving churrs.
First created during a dream. Can be improved by touching it.
First use of a levitating hand is... not very helpful.
Second and more times than not, the world is dark and ether is neutral.
I'LL MAKE SURE OF IT!!!
It is.
ULTIMATE DANGER!!!
YOU'RE TOTALLY A ZOMBIE!!!
I am not a baby!!!
You're a total idiot.
Nobody said you could not be funny.
I just need that little green stripe to prove it.
He isn't like you?
embedded code
Simple yes.
Now you're fired.
Same as it ever was.
Into the dark.
Hey buddy.
I know everything here.
Not even a single thing that you did here.
Well that's not very nice...
Pathetic.
You're not that nice.
No...
I'm not... that nice.
Oh yeah...
Try to be nice?
Try to be nice and let everyone know how you are.
Hope this works...
A strange research paper...
A few books and scattered papers.
There's a ledger resting on a table. Strange symbols litter the pages.
Record the journey so far? No Yes
The ink sinks into the page and fades out. Your progress has been saved.
The hopper stops and blips out.
Hey... pretty sure it's you?
Yeah?
Why do you ask?
Nah. I'm just saying you know the drill.
Nah?
I wanted to find a dusty copy of 'How to Clean a Dead Letter' and stuff.
So you got this and you need someone to wipe it off of?
I need this for... whatever reason.
I don't know what I'm capable of anymore...
Good you't.
You didn't need him.
He was too skilled.
Now he's gone.
I'm sure everyone is.
Nothing wrong with that.
Everyone does?
Yeah... maybe a little.
Maybe a little?
You're making this up.
I don't know...
Well when you figure it out you'll know.
You know what?
What do you think I should do?
I mean... nobody told me you could.
Well maybe you should start.
Yeah but, like, you kinda messed up.
What...?
Nah.
You didn't need him.
Wow... You look ridiculous.
You actually stayed.
Yeah, I was hoping to tell the story but then I forgot.
You're workin' ya'm not?
Nope.
Good... Now find a little rug.
Thanks, dude.
No problem. Alright, what do you need?
Nopener.
WHAT?!
OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH
NO SQUIRECAR!
YES SQUIRECAR!
I agree with that.
Well, you're right about a little thing.
Yeah... I guess.
But not enough...
Is he out of ideas?
Yeah... He's not even close...
Is he really out of ideas?
No...
Think about it, Square.
You know... You and I are just like you...
We read... You read jokes.
We laugh.
We know what you're doing.
You're doing it to stand up for what's right.
Not much of a stand up right now.
No one makes fun of you.
No one cares.
You're too weak.
To exist here.
Ignore the call.
I do what's right.
I'm a Squire.
This is nothing.
You're nothing like your supposed to be.
Wait... what?
If you're wrong...
JUST DO YOUR THINGS!
So much for progress.
It's like you...
I don't know what you expected.
Well... It's food for thought.
The last thing I wanted.
My thoughts led to food.
They didn't deserve anyone else's.
Well, things are looking up for you.
You're always ready.
Just one more mistake would ruin everything.
I'm not ready...
I'm you again.
I'm the BOSS!
What an awesome friend. So humble. So humble.
Oh don't look at me like that.
Sorry...
Just give me a sec and we can get back to bed.
Thanks, dude.
We gotta get back
