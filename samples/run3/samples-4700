 covered for sale on the dark side.
Mystery wood work and glowing doors.
A ledger sits on a cool smooth stone.
Record the journey so far? No Yes
The ink sinks into the page and fades out. Your progress has been saved.
The air is cold and clings to your skin. This place can't be real. Maybe if you wake up it will go away.
Try to wake up? No Yes
Miss me, maroon? Come sit down!
Miss me, kiddo? Hug me back to truth and light!
Hey, bud.
Ok.
A book. The pages are covered in brown ink.
Record the journey so far? No Yes
Miss me, red? Come sit down!
Miss me, hunter? Follow my magic, bud.
Huh... Let's roll.
LEAVE THE BALL!
Wait... hazing is illegal in Newhire?
I'm totally fine with it. I'm sure everyone has at some point.
It looks like a cheap lamp.
Blinking lights in the dark.
Maybe it's just me?
I. The Lamp.

I'm not even mad.
 HEY!
I'm not mad either...
IM STILL WATCHING YOU!!!
Wait... really?
I... I don't know what to make of this.
What is this?
It's a frog.
WHAT IN THE HECK IS THIS?
Oh, hey that's totally new!
ALL OF THIS?!
All of this?
GEODY!
you can't be serious!
I... I should be embarrassed.
I don't think I'm that impressive.
So what did you have in mind?
Uhh...?
For making me laugh?
Oh yeah. Is that so... good?
Uhh... don't think so?
You don't say...
I do say.
Oh... sorry...
A couple of misgendering marks are unavoidable.
Don't worry about it.
It's over.
I think I pinned you to the chair enough that you needed help.
It wasn't that hard.
Just a little heavy handed.
You're kind of a maroon.
You also have a habit of slipping.
You're a maroon?
Nope!
Also...
I'm a maroon?
Yeah... Sorry.
So... what's the plan, bud?
I better get going, because this isn't a good time.
Wait... what?
I got this.
What...?
You indecisive child.
What are you doing?
Watching me helplessly.
0 life points.
You have no idea what you's doing.
God... this is sick.
You sure? You're weak.
I know you are.
That's what parents do sometimes. Let them know you're ok... and leave us alone if you're not careful.
I'll be right back! up front with you immediately.
Alright...
So what's going on?
You saw a bunch of weird stuff.
Huh... nothing.
You're either with me or you're not.
I'm not sure which.
You're right.
I probably am.
You're wrong.
You're right.
I need to find... Whistler the Animist?
Tell her what you know?
It's a hat.
I don't know what she looks like.
You sure? She looks pretty beat up.
Oh... yeah of course.
Awesome.
Alright...
You'll need to find a pool of your own making.
Making sure to do so is what I do.
I understand your passion for gaming is, like, really good at what it says.
So you're working on her?
Yeah, but that's not the biggest problem.
Let's get going then.
Yeah, I know that.
A minute.
We're out for blood.
Oh yeah? What?
Eatin' blood. DON'T DO THIS!!!
You got what you've got.
Hey, thanks.
Yeah, sorry...
Don't worry about it. We got some work to do.
Ugh... what was that?
Welp... just got home from work.
Well... no problem.
You got what you've got.
So... what are we doing?
Making ribbons. DON'T DO THIS!!!
Hey...pretty sure it's too late for me.
Man, you're lucky
