Torn to shreds... to no... yes
It smells like too much food.
It feels like it's been stored up for years.
It's not ready... but it will be soon.
It's not ready... but it will be soon.
It poisoned...
Don't worry about it.
She warned you.
You're stronger than her.

What if I don't want it?
Then you are a false god.
You are doomed.
Definitely not stronger than him.
He can reach for the weak.
No.
That's not good enough.
We improved our techniques...
We can beat this.
What is?
It grants wishes.
You can't do that... Woot.
So you want to keep your dream alive?
I guess... I hope you think differently.
You should check out the mirror.
It's time to get out of here.
You're right, Newhire!
Living as a lab rat is sometimes harder than you think.
You should get out of here.
You're right, Newhire!
It's full of scrapped engineering ideas.
What could have made these?
The ladder is in the drawer.
The power is out.
The only way to push it back is to muck it.
That's not a threat DESPOY IT!
How do you feel? Without warning the power is running out.
It's breaking even here.
Get out of here.
You're right, Newhire!
It's full of scrapped engineering ideas.
What could have made these?
The power to home away.
I would have locked myself away without a set time for this.
It's full of plans for the future.
It's full of ideas for going back to sleep.
These aren't for everyone.
Not every path is up on the path to becoming a better terran.
Are you ready terrors?
We the Men take precedence.
Newhire, stop wasting our time.
You're right, Newhire!
It's full of ideas for going back to sleep.
These are for the rest of your days.
Shelly needs advice.
They all do.
He's not here yet.
But... Shelly needs to know.
He's not here yet.
But... Shelly.
You're not listening to him.
You're always doing this.
I am the One, Newhire.
Who am I?
What shall I do?
Electrocute the puppet?
No.
What shall I do?
Go on...
MEOW MEOW MEOW MEOW MEOW MEOW MEOW MEOW MEOW MEOW MEOW MEOW MEOW MEOW MEOW MEOW MEOW MEOW MEOW MEOW MEOW MEOW MEOW
I will not allow you to control my destiny.

Wait... what?
I...
This is ridiculous.
This is how it should be.
This was the plan...
But he's not real.
A manipulator.
A manipulator.
You know what... He's really hard on himself.
I'm glad you see things my way.
Plot twist... twist...
He's not real.
You know what...? He's not real.
I'm glad you see things his way. He's not real.
You know what...? He's real.
You caught him before you could catch him.
Plot twist... twist... twist...
He's not real.
You know what...? He's real.
I'm glad you see things his way. He's not real.

I'm glad you caught him before you could catch him.
Then you had better get going.
You've got to get going.
You're right.
I'm not going to hide...
ACid issues...
Hunting bugs...
Hunting bugs......
No problem...
Hunting bugs......
Yeah... You're a big fan.
Just have to figure that one out.
Hey, you made it!
Yeah, sorry...
Don't worry about it.
I'm sure everyone has at some point.
I mean... Some days it's not so bad.
You just have to find a few tricks and let it settle.
I'm not talking about being a great sleight of hand.
Alright...
There you go, that was pretty clever of you.
Thanks for your help.
