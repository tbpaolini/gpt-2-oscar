Seriously.
Get Joe his coffee? No Yes
No.
No?
No.
Hey Whistler?
Hey Joe.
The kid doesn't want to do his job.
That's pretty unfortunate, Joe.
You're lookin' a little sweaty there. You sure about this kid?
Are you sure about this? No No
Alright, fine. I can do that.
Good, catch you later.
Ugh... fine I'll do it.
That's the spirit, Intern.
I don't see any coffee.
Oh hey, you brought it.
Yeah, here you go.
That's fine. I don't even like coffee.
Keep the change. Get yourself a drink. You deserve it.
......
Oh don't look at me like that.
....
Bah, fine. I'm sorry. Lemme teach ya something in return.
Alright, this better not be a trick though.
Do you know how to whistle?
Nope.
Alright well, scrunch your face up and blow.
.....
Uhh... A little less... all of that.
.................
There ya go!
Hey... thanks, Joe.
Any time, Intern.
Another day. Another dollar. Another coffee.
Can't seem to get their attention.
A sharp whistle rings out across the... water?
Hey.
Uhh... hey?
Small stripe need a thing?
Small green need a thing?
What kind of thing?
Pool Pal Paul will show.
Yeah, alright...
The strange liquid is calm and unmoving.
Hey, thanks Paul!
Yep yep, bye!
Hey, you heard any good rumors?
Yeah. I heard about a guy who asks too many questions.
Oh yeah? What's his name? I gotta know the details.
You tell me.
Come back when you have some juicier rumors.
It's the most massively useful thing in the universe. Shame someone left it here.
This bench looks extra comfy. You could take a nap if you weren't on the case.
It's a Tower Corp brand umbrella table. There's a little tag on it... 'Keep Away From Raccoons'.
Can't hear you, Intern. Come around the front.
Oh yeah, don't use your newfound skill near the pool.
Why not?
Just trust me, Intern.
Hah, bold move.
Well, OScar did say I'm bad at following directions.
Your funeral, Intern.
That was a close one...
Enjoy shiny, tasty stripe.
Enjoy shiny, tasty green.
Tasty...?
A small golden heart. There's a picture inside of a younger man with glasses. He looks familiar.
A deliciously painful memory is tied to that object.
Where are you...?
Wherever I like.
Well... nobody said you could talk.
Stop me then.
I... I don't know how...
Good. Embrace that helpless feeling.
Now pick up the object.
Alright...
Hold it tightly and close your eyes.
What... was that...?
Something painful. Something hidden. Gnawing its way forward.
I just gave it a little... push.
Find more like this. I want you to feel the rest.
Not enough... I need more...

Hey buddy.
I know things can get tough sometimes.
Just don't forget to have fun, even if it all looks grim.
Follow your heart and don't give up on anything or anyone.
I will always be with you, right by your side.
We got this.
Don't worry about today. A little bump in the road is not a big deal.
A sickly world of sand and cactus under a pale green sky. The wind howls against the glass.
A hauntingly beautiful forest in the dead of night. The moon has a chunk taken out of it.

Hey, Stripefriend!
Hey, Greenfriend!
Uh... hey?
Sorry about Emelio... He gets a bit caught up in being a hero.
It's alright. People make mistakes sometimes.
TODO: This needs to reflect what Lore learned in terms of conflict due to Jotunheim.
Yeah... He was a bit rough but thankfully I'm alright.
Anyway, I wanted to give you something for the trouble.
What is this?
It's a pocketwatch.
