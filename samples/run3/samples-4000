======== SAMPLE 1 ========
't know what to do.
Heres to Capsule.
Look! Faceless Void!
Seeya, Nerd City!
Can't make it to lunch yet!
Seeya, Nerd City!
Seeya, Nerd City!
Man, it's been super busy.
How are you?
I'm doing pretty well.
What...?
I... nothing.
So you tried to kill me?
I actually fired the last shot. You're lookin... kind of lethargic.
That wasn't very Emotionally Responsive for a while.
Thankfully I'm pretty malformed.
That isn't all...
You and I just met on the news.
That isn't very Emotionally Responsive.
Well... we're always interested...
Well... we're all oriented the same and So this is it...
Looks like we have everything.
We all seem kinda the same.
At least... not like before.
You're looking quite the bit.
Yeah I guess I spilled a gallon of gas on you.
Don't worry I won't sugars get me.
I don't even have a car.
You're right. I do.
How long has it taken you to get used to mice?
Nothing.
Is that all of them?
Yeah... little bits?
Fernies? Yes.
Things that are hard to come by but are still cool and shiny.
Just a bunch of greasy moles.
They're gone but for a small redirection there is at the bottom.
That's a worm!
That's a worm!
That's a nasty one!
Are you a nasty friend?
Nope!
Neat...
But what are you tasty for?
Grrggght...(grumble))
That's a nasty cousin of mine.
What do you say...?
I'll help you...
In fact I'm good at this.
Who... would I help you with?
Couldn't say... I'm an asshole...
That's just rude...
Not my type...
So. Try not to say anything...
I'm not sure what you're talking about.
Not my type either.
So. Try not to say anything.
I see you've killed some high level systems tinkering animals.
Looks like a smart dingus.
Wouldn't it be nice if I was?
Not unless you were spying on my husband's ranch.
Then let me know if you need help.
Except... he's not real.
So... what now?
Wanna know?
Well... you pretty much have to do... every step of the way.
I understand... I's that overrated thing.
Just one more thing I've learned.
Don't do this.
I don't care about you.
You don't have to do anything this step.
Just one more thing I've learned.
Don't worry my buddy.
He's stronger now.
I see... I've found the secret to unlocking the sapling of inner peace.
Working in an office can be stressful.
Never thought about it that way.
So... how are things going?
Well, it's definitely tough.
Especially when you get tasked with all of this.
Thanks... I'll try not to get a response.
I shall... not...
This will not be easy...
It will be fun...
Just like any other... job.
Just... right now.
Nothing to see there.
And then...
Well that's not all...
You had a good time today.
Give it up for another day me up, Gamer.
I hear you'll need all of that space.
It's not very bright out in the back.
Numismatic pounding on the counter makes me groan.
It's filled with eggs. Stripe at least.
They've been eggcilled for hours.
They seem to always want to smash eggs.
I like them so much... Over to you from the other end.
You can't copyright my sound.
It's been copied too! It's almost over the bad part.
I'm not a soundmaster and this isn't even my first time.
I own no means and points of view... I'm just a programmer.
Programming eyes glisten in your vision.
That's just the way I'm designed.
You're not programming.
I'm not programming.
That's totally fair.
There's a password in here. It needs to be filled out.
Fill out the entire password pool. I'll get in your way.
Alright you do it.
The intruder has been assigned a table across the hall.
The first person to be assigned to it is the second person.
The cabinet is covered in cabinet supplies.
