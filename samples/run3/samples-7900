======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 this cycle? No Yes
The ink sinks into the page and fades out. Your progress has been saved.
The thrum of ringing phones fills the air. You slowly nod your head to the sound, fighting back sleep.
Sleep on the job? No Yes
Q: How can you read with this many ducks? A: You can't.
You look too ridiculous to read right now.
Squire...
...?
We have many paths in life.
The ones we choose aren't always the best.
But... they're ours.
They define us.
They make us who we are.
Do you know who you are? No Yes
That's not a bad thing.
What do you mean?
Life is a journey of discovery.
We don't have to skip to the end to enjoy it.
I don't understand...
It's alright if you don't right NOW.
You will in time.
We all do eventually.
I see...
There's still time to change.
Things don't have to be this way.
Do you want things to be this way? I can fix this. This is how it should be.
Do you want things to be this way? No  Yes 
I don't blame you for what you've done.
However, there is no going back.
You can't undo the past.
Don't worry though, Squire... You will do better.
I know you will.
We don't choose how others remember us.
Just...
Be the hero of your own story.
Even if you weren't the hero of mine.
The sapling stands steady in the breeze.
Not your time. Not your place.
I'm a chameleon.
You wanna hang out? Yes No
Here we go!
See you tomorrow then.
WHERE IS IT? WHERE IS THE MONSTER?!
Emelio wait... That's my Greenfriend, not a monster!
Your time has come to an end, creature of darkness.
HAVE AT YOU!!!
WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU DOIN?!
I felled the monster...?
Emelio, yer head is harder than yer hammer. This thing isn't a monster.
I... I see... I've made an error most grave.
I'm fine. He didn't even hit me that hard.
I'm alright... I've had worse... trust me.
That was pretty rough... Never been decked before...
Anyway... I need to find Baron and get back home.
Baron? Friend a yours I take it?
Before you ask, he's my...
You know... To be honest with you... I don't really know what he is right now...
Either way, part of him is here and I need to find it...
Alright you two, leave this one alone and get home. Got it?
Yes ma'am.
Sorry for the trouble...
An you... Be careful around town. They're a bunch of downright animals out there.
Thanks... I'll keep that in mind.
Emelio wait... That's my Stripefriend, not a monster!
Just more things standing in my way. Let's get on with it then.
I really gotta get out of here...
So you wanted this to happen...?
I mean... I don't think she really deserved that.
But hey, you're the boss.
That was pretty brutal to watch.
I'm more of a talker than a fighter though.
You'd know that but you didn't stick around to find out.
You really just let her take you down like that?
I'm not sure if that was... sick or... sick.
You really couldn't stand up to her then.
I mean... I couldn't either. Let's be real.
Digging the brooding thing you got going on though.
Get it...? Digging? Because I'm a mole?
She's not real.
End the charade.
You know what to do. Cut the strings... Free the puppet...
You know what to do. End it...  End it...

Pffffffttt...
BAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
Knew I'd get ya.
Yeah... you really did.
So now with you de-spookified... What's the plan, dude?
I... Uhhh... I don't actually know.
That's alright.
It is?
Like I tried to tell you before.
You don't always have to have a direction in life.
Sometimes you just have to chill for a bit.
Yeah...
I should have listened to you.
Happens.
Looks like a lot of people paid for your mistakes though...
Just... don't
