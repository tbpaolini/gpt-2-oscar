ose.
The ducks shudder at the sight of the forest floor.
This must be where the costumes are shot.
There's a face in here. It's... Remus.
Emelio...?
What are you talking about...?
The one and only...
You're the wrong one.
I can't be friends with as little as I know.
No... You want to be?
Everyone wants to be friends?
Everyone wants to be friends? I'm yours!
You're just like them.
Everyone else.
You're nothing like you real life seems like.
Maybe you're not like them.
Maybe you're pretty rad after all.
Looks like 4C is open! Right next to that weird shirt guy. Have fun with the rest of your career!
Seeya, Nerdhire!
Are you sure you don't need any help?
It's only a picture book.
No books? Fine, why not?
Go with someone else?
Who needs books when you have fun working out?
I'm already done!
Wait... what?
I don't have a job on my hands yet.
Wait... what?
You're in my back pocket?
Yeah, like a pocketfull of laundry.
Yeah, like a pocket.
Hrm...
So you're working out with Fern?
Well yeah, I'm just that good.
I don't think I can catch a break.
Did you need anything?
I was just thinking about... work.
We should go, let's go. I gotta get back to work.
He'll be along shortly.
Ramul will be along shortly.
Come inside and warm up while we get ready to go.
Go ahead andify with me.
I saw that...
That's not what I expected.
You... Did you really just ambush me?
Nope.
So you're saying I'm bluffing?
He didn't use his position well.
I won't let him get me wrong.
Still, it's better than underestimating you.
What's the plan, Fern?
Get back to work. I gotta get back to work.
You really can't promise me... will it be worth it?
Maybe.
Still, it's still not enough.
I don't know...
Hey, don't give up.
You've got all the TIME in the world to fix this thing.
Well, I guess...
You also got all the TIME in the world to fix this thing.
You really can't do this.
What...?
What do you mean?
Caveat: This isn't real.
But it IS real.
You're right! I-I will fix this.
Oh yeah, don't worry about it. Something bad will happen if you don't go first.
Don't worry about it.
I'm not a big kid... so what do I have to do?
Go with Fern? No Yes
You'll need to find a better job.
Maybe a better job?
What if I don't go?
Then you'll be missing out on a new experience.
Never thought about it that way.
Don't worry about it.
You really can't blame her for that.
Thanks...
We'll see you back home.
I gotta get back to work.
Uhh... sorry...
Don't worry about it.
The door won't open for long.
Good luck out there.
Hey man, you made it!
I'm Back! It's always Back!
Anytime!
YOU CAUGHT THE FOOD BIRD!!! YOU'RE INCREDIBLE!!!
I did?!
YES!!!
Uh... where is it then?
I have no idea.
Seriously?
You passed out shortly after...
IT WAS AMAZING!!! YOU WERE AMAZING!!!
Well... thanks.
We don't have anything for lunch now though.
True...
Doesn't mean we didn't have fun.
True.
So... what now?
Well, it's a nice day... Wanna hang out for a bit?
You're wasting time.
She doesn't care about you.
Hang out with Rhode? Yes No
Disgusting.
You'll never learn.
You're just a pawn.
They aren't real.
Ahh... Well, that's cool too.
See you around... I guess...
Wait... REALLY?!
Yeah, why not?
I just thought you wouldn't want to stick around.
I mean... I was kind of a maroon a minute ago...
Don't worry about it. Everyone makes mistakes.
Don't worry about it.
I guess you're right... Why not?
So what did you have in mind?
