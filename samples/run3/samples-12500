======== SAMPLE 1 ========
's the most important thing, dear brother.
WHAT?!
You didn't just smash my door.
You even took the broken sock off of your stepfather.
That's a FACT!
THE REGRETTI!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
HOW COULD YOU DIE?!
I... Uh...
I won't let you do that.
That's quite alright, dear brother.
JUST STOP!!!
Or what?
Or...
Or...
Oh... feel free to go.
I don't have any friends here.
Well, you don't have much in the way of... brains.
Alright...
Take my tools as you go.
Right... I mean... the gear is in the wood but not the others.
Shouldn't it work then?
It looks like it's gone through a lot.
Maybe you should give it some TIME.
Why are you like this...
Because if I was any other way it wouldn't be as fun.
True.
Also... Don't worry about the tools.
I got my disposal today.
What...?
Vaporcave inbetween clicks as you try to extract a flower.
The device whirrs to life with a happy sound.
Some loose folders with scraps of paper strewn about.
A single sticky note is glued to the shelf...
The water cooler stands idly by waiting to hear untold stories of office life.
Small multi-colored papers litter the board. The words seem to shift as you try to read them.
A sock note is pinned to the board. Informative!
The handle rattles but the door remains unmoved.
A small keypad is stuck to the desk.
Where... Where am I...?
Baron...? Are you here...?
Dude... no.
A jar of nasties sits neatly in the drawer.
The jar of pickles evaporates.
The drawer lays empty and pickleless.
A newspaper is lying on the bench.
A newspaper is lying on the bench.
A newspaper is lying on the desk.
It's a Guardian named Niflheim.
Hello again, Niflheim.
It's nice here... quiet.
It's nice here... soft.
It's a different page.
Hey, thanks Paul.
Yeah, this one isn't tough.
Hey, you found a mud snake.
Oh... Sorry...
Don't worry about it.
I mean... I was a bad joke.
You really did it.
It's full of even more papers.
Sorry...
Don't worry about it.
I meant to say nice things...
Anyway... what did you actually done?
Got me a bag of nasties.
Seriously...?
A bag of pickles?
Nope!
So what happened anyway?
Someone ran into you and knocked you out.
Someone...?
Someone.
And then someone brought me in here?
Yep.
Why...?
Definitely not to feed you to my snake or anything.
Wait... what?
Just to make me feel like I didn't miss a single one of them.
Oh yeah? Alright...
Nice.
You'll need to find a Sunstone at the bottom of the mine.
Alright...
Is this it?
Is this what it feels like?
Are you ready for what comes next?
Is this what it feels like?
No...
Is this what it feels like?
No.
Alright...
Here we go!
How about a frame?
Oh yeah!
I would be honored.
So... wood set!
Yeah sure.
Better safe upgrade though, man.
Better safe than sorry.
Alright...
Designation here?
What are you named for Baron?
Look to the past.
To the future.
Some kind of planning...
A clock is shorn...
Do you want to keep it? No Yes
Let's roll.
Push it? No Yes
There's no going back.
What was I thinking...?
Look to the past.
To the future.
There's no going back.
What was I thinking...?
Look to the past.
To the future.
There's no going back.
What was I thinking...?
Look to the future.
You're still capable of being what you are today.
I wish I could be.
It's harder to reach for things like that.
Especially when you want to run into new ground.
It's harder to reach for things like that.
I see...
So... what are you doing?
I'm telling you what...
You'll do it.
Just tell her what?
Tell her what?
I'm telling you.
And now it's for... her.
You know what?
