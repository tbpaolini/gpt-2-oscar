This is what I wanted from you.
I didn't want you to boring me with my boring career.

It's not too late to turn this around.
I believe in you.

That little dude is intense. Like a fire at the circus.

Oh... Sorry if it came across that way.

Just gonna close my eyes and relax instead.
All you had to do was open your eyes again.
Oh hey, you found them.
That's pretty rad of you. Thanks for reminding me.
Yeah... I guess?
I don't really know what to say...
Well... maybe you're right...
I guess?
Uhh... what are you thinking?
Well... maybe you're right...
You really think so?
Well he's pretty quick to reaction to my presence.
Well he looks like he needs it.
It's not the best...
Oh... sorry...
Don't worry about it.
Yeah sure.
Hello again, stranger across the sea...
What did you just say to me?
Oof...
You're kinda chilled. You look like you need it.

What kind of monster?
She's pretty messed up.
Well... yeah... maybe you're right.
I should have listened to you.
I should have paid more attention to what was going on.
I just got so wrapped up in work that I forgot what it meant to be a dad.
I let you down.
You're right. You did.
I'm sorry...
Hey, dad?
Yes?
It's fine... I've lost count of how many times I've regretted it eventually.
You're correct...
It's not even the first time.
Even when I was younger it was hard for me to handle myself.
I'm sorry...
Good thing I'm ready in time.
I've still got your back.
Thanks, Joe.
No problem, Intern.
We better get going then, huh?
