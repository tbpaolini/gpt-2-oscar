======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 issue...
You should have stuck with your gut.
My gut?
Yeah dude. You were right... You told me to go with my heart.
But then you second guessed yourself...
Of course I did.
I don't know you, or Rhode. At least... not really.
How could you expect me to help you?
You know... you're not wrong.
You also kind of suck.
What...?
When we went to lunch you didn't help at all.
You just sat there dodging flowers.
Then you told me you wanted to fail.
Well maybe I did.
Well maybe you suck.
And now I'm dead. So maybe everything sucks.
It's all fun and games until the deer hits the fan isn't it?
Are you... really dead?
Yeah... I guess?
If I'm not then what is this place?
Like, look at those things.
The heck is that? Honestly...
I try not to think about them...
Yeah... maybe that's for the best.
When we went to lunch you didn't fill a single basket.
Yeah and I told you it wasn't my fault.
You try catching a bunch of stuff with a basket on your head.
Huh... I never thought about it that way.
Well maybe you should start.
Yeah and you said not to!
Yeah well...
Yeah well nothing.
You made that choice.
You told me to do this.
You chose to listen.
What...?
Why do you need someone else to tell you who to love?
Why is that my choice?
I...
Look...
Maybe I lied...
And maybe I feel bad about it...
Maybe isn't a great answer here.
Well... maybe is all I've got right now.
Hey look...
All of this...
It's just a lot.
I'm sorry, bud.
I'm sorry too...
It's water under the bridge.
Uhh... bad analogy considering how I went out but you get the idea.
So like... time for the hard part right?
Yeah... feels like it.
Well then... here we go.
Is this how you wanted things to go down?
Is this what you wanted? I want to fix this. You deserve this.
Wait... really?
Yeah... this isn't right.
Well if that's how you feel then I know you can do it.
Hey... pretty sure it's too late for me.
But there will be others...
Help them...
Turn this whole thing around.
Good luck out there.
You know...
Never thought I'd say this but...
I'm glad.
I wouldn't want to spend my life...
Knowing someone like you was out there anyway.
Imagine where things would be...
If you had only stopped at one.
Here to watch me get RIPPED? Nah Yea
Tch, thought so... nerd.
Anyway, someone left some junk on the bench. I threw it down below if you want it.
Don't get in my way, nerd. PUMPIN' IRON is dangerous work.
Hey, nerd. You blanked for a minute there like a weirdo.
You found a sweaty gym sock. Exercise!
This locker is locked. Guess it takes its job seriously.
There's an old red combination lock on it. Someone carved a 'C' into the knob. It won't open.
It's full of hundreds of pairs of round glasses. They don't even have lenses.
There's a smooth metallic object in here. It's the back of the locker.
It's smashed closed and can't be opened. It looks like it took hundreds of tiny punches.
The locker stands sockless before you. It seems lonely.
Working out with a buddy makes things pretty easy.
Especially when your buddy is as quick as Chomper.
Gives me something to shoot for.
Working out with a buddy makes things pretty easy.
Especially when your buddy is as slow as Trapper. HAH HAH HAH!!!
Oh yeah? Well, I'm catching up!
IMPOSSIBLE!!!
He's too busy jogging to hear you.
He's too busy running to hear you.
The bracelet feels cheap... like painted plastic.
A deliciously painful memory is tied to that object.
Where are you...?
Wherever I like.
Well... nobody said you could talk.
Stop me then.
I... I don't know how...
Good. Embrace that helpless feeling.
Now pick up the object.
Alright...
Hold it tightly and close your eyes.
What... was that...?
Something painful. Something hidden. Gnawing its way forward.
I just gave it a little... push
