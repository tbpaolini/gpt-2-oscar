======== SAMPLE 1 ========
I made a mistake when you first asked me.
I don't know how...
What did you have in mind?
We could go to lunch. I think you found a bunch on your way to work.
I hope you made the right choice...
Did you notice? What kind of person you are.
You're definitely not.
Have you tried taking medications?
No. I believe in you.
What happened?
You hurt him.
I hurt you again.
This isn't... how it was supposed to be.
You're hurting him.
I won't let you hurt him again.
I won't let you hurt him like this.
I won't let you hurt him like this.
You're starting to think I'm the monster here.
Yes...
You're starting to think I'm the hero.
Hah, yeah yeah yeah.
....
You thought you could just read my thoughts?
I didn't have any thoughts to write...
Truth in Pictures?
Yeah yeah.
Yeah because I'm a writer.
Yeah so you do?
Every time I do... it feels good.
You're getting stronger. Don't listen to him.
I'm not against you. I don't think it's right.
You're starting to trust me.
Yeah... maybe you're right.
I... I don't know...
Yeah... maybe.
....
You're not listening to me.
I'm not watching you.
It's just a stick.
I don't know what it is?
Maybe some kind...?
Wait... stick...?
What kind of stick?
Population 790
Yeah stuff.
Population was criminal.
They're out to get me but I feel alright.
I get up then go see if anyone's there.
Couldn't be...
I'm so used to standing in line just toeing the knot that I didn't feel the need to feel the need to feel the need.
This is my first time working here and I need to feel the rest.
I'm getting pretty tired so I'm going to start right now.
He won't let me in.
He's already starting.
He's just starting out.
This isn't... What was I thinking...?
I don't know what happened here...
Maybe I didn't want to.
I don't know what...
It's not comforting...
I don't know what...
It's telling me...
A good fight?
Bad fight?
You know what... Fine.
I gotta get back to work.
You again...
I don't know what...
He didn't need to be there.
ESRB HARDER THAN AN OFUMS ME!!!
I gotta get back to work...
Ugh... fine.
EASTER THAN AN OFUMS ME!!!
I've have ASHES ME!!!
You're already done?
Yeah... sorry.
Don't worry about it. My problem, not yours.
Ahh... yes. Of course...
Just give me a moment.
BEHOLD!
Wait... you're already done?
Yes. I mean... I don't think she really deserved that.
But hey, you're the boss.
You again... don't give up.
I'm glad you agree.
It's nothing... I've still got my work cut out for me.
But don't worry about it. I got stuff to do.
Today is marked with a big red circle.
Huh... I never thought about it that way.
Anyway... thanks for rest.
Hey, you're not supposed to be here.
I know I've got my work finished but...
Yeah well, yeah I'm sorry.
Now we all know the truth...
We're all on the same page together.
IKAAI!!!
What...?
You...
Everything to do with him.
You know what...? Fine.
I guess I don't live up to your expectations.
I'm sure everyone has in the past...
I mean... you wouldn't want to spend your life in the past.
I'm glad you asked.
What do you mean?
You really wanted to spend your life lying to me.
I mean... I don't think anyone in particular.
What do you mean?
You really wanted to waste my time.
Seriously...?
Yeah...
I think I hit on you too early.
Wow... You look ridiculous.
You're clearly too skilled to waste your time here in IT.
I'm sure... Joe, Bo, and Carol will be out of here within seconds.
I gotta get back to work.

Well...vez cambio!
The power is still on,
