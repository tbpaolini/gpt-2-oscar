======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 I can help.
It is important for others to follow in their own hearts and not follow their own.
I would ask you to be more open with yourself.
What path will you take?
I would choose the path I was in the most.
You have been injured, Squire.
Less hurt.
Good...
I can help.
It must be saving up is hard.
I understand...
What...
Don't you...
You feel bad about your injuries.
They were done and tacked onto...
I'm glad I went with what I had.
What was that like?
It was much more than a role.
They weren't even flowers.
That's not what I wanted.
I wanted to help them.
They deserved it.
I did my best.
I was injured...
I'LL LOSE!!!
I WASTA BE!!!
BUTTONS!!!
They were all messed up.
I'm so sorry to say that my friend you defeated was an... inhumane one.
You're almost there. Your time has now been saved.
I'm sure about that.
I'm not a fighter.
I followed your leads.
We hit it out of the blue.
We didn't actually kill him.
I don't know if I'm capable of such a thing, but you did...
You made that choice.
That's not pretty.
You're not even supposed to be here.
This is supposed to be valuable to everyone here.
Not everyone makes this choice.
Well... I guess...
You're right.
None of us do here.
You're also wrong.
Everyone makes mistakes here.
It's not anything like home...
Maybe you're right...
I... may be wrong...
I didn't even realize what I was doing...
I would get cold feet.
Hey BUDDY.
Welcome to The Watercooler. You must be familiar with my frequently scheduled trilling routine.
No surprises.
No surprises.
No surprises.
This job is no longer for me.
I'm sorry...
Good, now we're friends.
I've got my ducks. Do your best.
Duck, duck, duck, duck... Do your best.
Duck, duck, duck... Duck, duck, duck... I'm keeping an eye on you.
I'm notlings...
You're a terrifying creature.
And I'm sending a message.
Make them pay...?
Yeah... I guess.
You're right... It's hard not to fall for the funny blanket.
Yeah, you could say that.
Well... I'm sending a warning.
PURR GROSS...
って物り?
Uhh... A little less... all of that.
No... no...
It's alright.
You did nothing wrong.
I'm glad you understand.

You're almost there.
Stay back and I'll be on my lunch break.

Yeah well, thanks.
I think I'm done here.
