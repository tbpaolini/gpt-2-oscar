======== SAMPLE 1 ========
Thanks up. I stole the shades.
The loonies went to my expense? No Yes
Nice, now I'm not going to get my ducks.
What...?
Put them away. You should be able to find them.
The ducks?
Yes.
You see a lot of duck fur.
Yeah wonder what the big red mushroom looks like.
Yeah wonder what the big brown mushroom is...?
Oh, and the weird... furry features?
These are not on the shelf. They're on the table.
No need to unlock the shelf.
Oh hey, you found them.
Yeah, here you go.
Good luck! Don't mow your own!
I'm actually going to help you out, man.
That's my intern! She means company.
Hurry up, Newhire. I don't have all day.
Someone's been destroying the city through his work.
Huh... that looks pretty nasty.
It's Newhire. He's a total dork.
You? How do you know?
By looking at him.
Thanks...
He's not real here.
Everything we did here.
You made that choice.
You told me to do this.
You chose to listen.
What...?
Why do you need someone else to tell you who to love?
Why is that my choice?
I...
Look...
Maybe I lied...
And maybe I feel bad about it...
Maybe isn't a great answer here.
Well... maybe is all I've got right now.
Hey look...
All of this...
It's just a lot.
I'm sorry, bud.
I'm sorry too.
It's water under the bridge.
Uhh... bad analogy considering how I went out but you get the idea.
So like... time for the hard part right?
Yeah... feels like it.
Well then... here we go.
Is this how you wanted things to go down?
Is this what you wanted? I want to fix this. You deserve this.
Wait... really?
Yeah... this isn't right.
Well if that's how you feel then I know you can do it.
Hey... pretty sure it's too late for me.
But there will be others...
Help them...
Turn this whole thing around.
Good luck out there.
You know...
Never thought I'd say this but...
I'm glad.
I wouldn't want to spend my life...
Knowing someone like you was out there anyway.
Imagine where things would be...
If you had only stopped at one.
Here to watch me get RIPPED? Nah Yea
Tch, thought so... nerd.
Anyway, someone left some junk on the bench. I threw it down below if you want it.
Don't get in my way, nerd. PUMPIN' IRON is dangerous work.
Hey, nerd. You blanked for a minute there like a weirdo.
You found a sweaty gym sock. Exercise!
This locker is locked. Guess it takes its job seriously.
There's an old red combination lock on it. Someone carved a 'C' into the knob. It won't open.
It's full of hundreds of pairs of round glasses. They don't even have lenses.
There's a smooth metallic object in here. It's the back of the locker.
It's smashed closed and can't be opened. It looks like it took hundreds of tiny punches.
The locker stands sockless before you. It seems lonely.
Working out with a buddy makes things pretty easy.
Especially when your buddy is as quick as Chomper.
Gives me something to shoot for.
Working out with a buddy makes things quick.
Especially when your buddy is as slow as Trapper. HAH HAH HAH!!!
Oh yeah? Well, I'm catching up!
IMPOSSIBLE!!!
He's too busy jogging to hear you.
He's too busy running to hear you.
The bracelet feels cheap... like painted plastic.
A deliciously painful memory is tied to that object.
Where are you...?
Wherever I like.
Well... nobody said you could talk.
Stop me then.
I... I don't know how...
Good, now get going.
What was that?
Grab the object.
Hold it tightly and leave me alone.
Just like you did before.
The memory will resume its action.
You returned safely, Emelio.
My pleasure.
That was a close one...
One of the photos evidencewards.
The memory is neutralized by the time you're through.
The photo persists in some measure... sense of completion.
I see you found the bird husbandry book.
That's a duck!
Well
