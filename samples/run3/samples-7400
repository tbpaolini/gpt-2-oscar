 is all.
So... what's on your mind?
I don't really know...
It's just this:
Life is too good...
Don't we all?
I think we should give it a shot.
What are you waiting for?.
LORE!!!
CHEESE!!!
OH NO!!!
He's out like a light.
Who made you this way?
I...
Pleasure to meet you.
The door is already open.
Sorry,...
Don't worry about it.

Sorry,...
Sorry,...
Don't worry about it.
I got this.
You got this.

for...?
For the...

Is that...
Clare?
Yeah... sorry...
I just thought...
Wait...
Maybe you're right...
Maybe I'm wrong...
Hey, you're wrong.
Just let us guess random...
Oh yeah...
Well, that was kind of rough...
Just thinking about something.
Maybe.
Conversations aren't always meant to be a two person ordeal.
That's kind of the point of a convers...
You don't have to listen if you don't want to.
Anyway... Let's get going then.
Sorry for the trouble...
Don't worry about it.
Just let me know if you need help.
Alright...
So what's up?
Nothing...
Hey Lore?
What's up?
Your problem child.
 of late you're doing much better.
Yeah I guess?
Your problem?
Yeah...
I guess so...
I think you're right.
I think you're also pretty good at hiding.
You know...
You're right.
I think you're right...
I REALLY am wrong.
Well... let's get going then.
You're right...
Thanks.
I'm still not out of breath and I looking pretty good.
That's good at first sight.
Well... I guess.
Well... I'm kinda stressed out.
I guess you're right...
I guess?
Yeah... I guess?
Yeah... I guess?
Yeah... I even lost my balance running into stuff.
All good things must come to an end eventually.
Hey, yeah Shutterstock.
That's pretty cool, man.
Thanks.
I don't think I can catch it.
Nope.
No worries.
Good on you for understanding.
So... The thing is...
It's just a bunch of thoughts.
Getting to know one another is the fun part.
Trying to figure out why someone does what they do.
Then... well... what is it?.
Selected for execution.
Knowing what matters most.
Grumbling at the end of the meal.
It's a hard food to say no.
Of course.
 Good job, Lore.
The next rack is just for the papers.
Oh yeah... The power is not on.
It's just finished eating...
A bunch of papers with all of the clutter.
Thisches... Split in half.
Why do you have so many coffee cups?
These just look like ink.
There are stacks of all of the garbage.
The rack is empty.
Knew I couldn't open the side.
Quickly.
Namaste.
Here we go, lads.
But wait, what...?
Help...?
No!
I can't fix this.
Just give it a shot.
Wait... what?
You can't just throw them away.
You can help others though... Don't hold back.
Just help them feel.
A heap of papers are scattered.
Caring a little...
A bunch of papers are scattered.
You're helping a little dude?
I'm not a guy to help around the house.
Shouldn't be doing this.
You're being a little silly.
Eat with a cold stare.
You fell on your face during the exploit.
She was making a lot of sense.
Are you alright?
Yeah... I just feel bad about the leftover coffee.
What should I be doing?
After all of this?
You can't be here...
Something wrong with you...
Took all of this...
You're not doing enough to improve the planet.
Is this why she hurt you?
What are you doing?
Sitting on the couch wasting time.
ORYS!
Oh yeah... I think we should get going.
Maybe Lore?
Sure, maybe we don't know it yet.
How do you feel?
Do you think you can fix it?
Well, yeah. I think we should
