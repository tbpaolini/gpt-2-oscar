======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 listening!
Let's roll! Get on the ground floor!
Hey! I'm not even sure if it's Rhode or Joe.
How do you know?
Do you even know what it is?
No...
I've heard it said...
It's not real...
Wait... It's not real?
You really couldn't be serious?
Oh...
You really?
I guess you're right.
So what did you have in mind?
Uhh...?
For hanging out?
Oh... man I'm not good at this kind of thing.
WAIT I HAVE AN IDEA!!!
Nice, what is it?
Close your eyes.
Oh come on, do it.
Alright... but I'm keeping an eye on you.
With your eyes closed?
Now open your eyes again.
Heh...
Something wrong?
Not at all...
Just haven't taken a minute to relax in a while.
I like to come out here when I'm stressed out.
Helps to get my mind off things for a little bit.
She doesn't matter.
Think about yourself.
How do you feel? She does matter.  She doesn't matter. 
How do you feel? Think about Rhode. Think about yourself.
They don't exist.
None of this does.
This changes nothing.
She isn't real.
Kind of stresses me out to be honest.
Really? We can go if you like...
No. It's fine...
Just that nagging sense of worry in the back of my head.
I think everyone gets that once in a while.
You know... maybe you're right.
I just don't see the point.
I don't see the point.
Hey... do it.
Say it. Say it. Say it.
Hey... yeah come on down.
Hey... do it.
Say it. Say it. Say it.
Hey... you done?
Yep. I think Ive killed enough zombies so far.
Hey... do it again?
Yep. I just don't know what to say for someone like you.
Hey... do it again?
Yeah what?
 You still can't get over...
That's not very nice...
Oh yeah... Sorry.
Don't worry about it. We all make mistakes sometimes.
LLamaLa...
You're right... I'm glad you turned things around.
Yeah... Maybe you're right...
Good.
You're doing pretty ok, though.
Not really... not much of a spender.
Well... I'm off to get a mug for myself.
What is?
You signed up for a bunch of bad advice. Bad advice.
Better not worry about what you're doing.
You're right... I'm right again.
IPHONE! Your lights are out. Don't worry about it.
Hey! My name is Terry. I'm from out of the blue world.
I'm from the blue world. You probably know that.
I'm sorry...
It's fine...
It's not... but I hope in time it can be.
Please leave us two alone. We need this to survive.
Eat with breakfast? No Yes
Eat with dessert? No Yes
That's it.
Off to enjoy the night? No Yes
Let's get going then. The bus is almost ready.
How about 4:45? They have so much food in them.
They have so much food in them. Did they even finish? meh
They even finished!
Thanks...
They probably did.
Maybe you're right...
I'm not really an animal.
Some things are known, little one.
Not really myself.
You are, child.
No...
You're not real.
Something strange is going on.
Gotta get to the bottom of it.
What are you talking about?
Something completely different.
Something completely out of place.
Something completely distinct.
Something strange is going on.
You're in for a treat. Something pretty nasty.
Terrifying huh?
What's the catch?
You get a job as a foodservice shift manager. As such I'm cougar reception.
Full time job with much better productivity.
Can't read yet...
I can! How efficient#$ is that?
It's nice in my presence.
Uhh... fine.
Good, now let's get you a hat.
This is ridiculous.
You're ridiculous.
Now that you look the size of a walnut.
You're kind of shabby.
The price for it? You're a rat.
You're a zombie.
You got this.
I'm an economist. Seriously.
Do I matter? No.
Nope.
