======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 speak, Newhire.
It's alright. People make mistakes sometimes.
TODO: This needs to reflect what Lore learned in terms of conflict due to Jotunheim.
Yeah... He was a bit rough but thankfully I'm alright.
Anyway, I wanted to give you something for the trouble.
What is this?
It's a pocketwatch. So you can watch the hours go by!
I don't know what the pocket part is for though...
It looks a little beat up.
It's a bit scuffed but that's ok.
It looks like someone smashed it.
Maybe Emelio can fix it? He's pretty good with stuff.
You can usually find him in The Watercooler.
Where are you?
At the bottom of the sea.
I'm Dead setting mast again.
True...
Well that's life as a pirate on my merry end.
What are you talking about...?
Back before he pushed you out.
This isn't right... It's not real...
You're lookin' so cheerful.
No...
You're not looking at me like that.
Hrm...
Yeah well, I'm sorry.
All that talk of home like a ham is pretty disappointing.
Yeah well, it's not the worst thing I've seen here.
Your price is my friend.
Hrm...
I'm sorry...
Good question... You don't have much in the way of stamina.
That's ok, I've had worse.
The sapling stands a good chance of dying of asphuliasis.
So you're saying I have the best days?
I'm pretty good, I suppose.
When I'm not being silly I like to laugh.
You and I are scales at best.
So long as you have a smile on it.
You're referring to my long hair and beard.
No, it's just a habit.
Ew...
Visions of yourself in a labcoat are all you've got so far.
That's a long time covered up ailment.
A rib hasured and the journey is complete.
In truth...
I see...
There's still time to change.
Things don't have to be this way.
Do you want things to be this way? I can fix this. This is how it should be.
Do you want things to be this way? No  Yes 
I don't blame you for what you've done.
However, there is no going back.
You can't undo the past.
Don't worry though, Squire... You will do better.
I know you will.
We don't choose how others remember us.
Just...
Be the hero of your own story.
Even if you weren't the hero of mine.
The sapling stands a good chance of dying of asphuliasis.
So you're saying I'm onto something?
I hope so...
Well, I hope.
What is it?
It's a rather large stone with a glowing stone head on it.
It's a pretty tall young man with a beard and a tattered sweater.
I see you've met the younger sister.
Miss Are you alright?
Yeah... I just feel bad about the mess.
What should we do now?
Here... Bring Baron back to me before it gets too cold.
Wait... what?
You lied to me.
You concealed it.
I believe you.
You really did.
I stand by my friend's story.
It's not my fault.
She lied to him.
I don't care about you or anywhere else.
You can be anything you want to be.
You're either with me or against.
What...?
What does that even mean?!
Don't worry about it.
At least... I mean... I was kind of brutal with you.
You're right. I'm sorry.
Don't worry about it. It's still a big deal.
At least... I've had more fun doing it then caring about her.
You know what? Fine.
I'm sick of you wasting my time.
Hurt them.
Make them pay? Yes Make them pay? No
Make them pay? No Yes?
You didn't do that.
She didn't do that.
I'm glad you turned things around.
You know what? Fine.
I'm sorry.
It's not her fault.
CHEESE BREAKS
It's full of tiny chunky... what could be better?
You try catching a bunch of tiny stuff with a stick?
This is going to get kind of awkward.
Where are you?
Wherever I like.
Well... nobody said you could talk.
Stop me then.
I... I don
