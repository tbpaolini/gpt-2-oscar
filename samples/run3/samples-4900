======== SAMPLE 1 ========
It's not my place to say it.
However, it is my domain.
You may.
I UNDERSTAND YOURSELF.
I am not and cannot be a noble.
I can learn much from you though.
Just... tell me what?
Ask me?
I SAID SELF?
That's it.
Alright then...
I will.
I SEE YOU IN THE HAND
~~~~~~~~
That's it?
That's it.
You made this choice.
It will not stand for it.
It will not survive.
It may be right but it is wise.
Don't give up.
You can be anything you want.
I have your back.
You can be any of us.
I will be the one to fix this.
Thank you for your loyalty.
Well done, Lore. You beat the system by doing nothing.
Thanks...?
I'm honored.
You'll have to figure that out on your own.
Thank you for your service.
Well... did anything go well?
Just a little overcast?
Yeah... Not So Good.
You know...
You're right... It's nothing...
You're right... It's almost time.
Time for your next trick...
How long is too short?
Fern... erase...
What...?
Fern... You saved my night.
I... don't know how...
There's a ledger set on this page. Points are awarded when data is lost.
You're correct... You're typical of the times.
It's a small note writing 'Lost Years'.
To understand what you're getting your eyes on you must know.
A small note writing 'Lost Years'.
That's it... You passed the time by reading on.
I know you're not here...
This works because you passed the test.
You are most trustworthy because you passed the test.
That's it... You're back out in the woods on your own.
I don't know if that's even fair...
You're being a bit sneaky.
You gave this a high chance but it didn't pan out.
It's your fault if things get tricky.
You're right...
You're right...
It's your choice.
I'm glad you understand.
I see...
People make mistakes sometimes.
Don't worry though... you're alright.
You did your best. Honestly I'm thankful for what you did.
You really did?
I am... confused...
You are confused...
You know what?
Yes...
Let's just get this over with.
No...
You really did?
I am confused...
How do you know?
By looking at us?
Look... confused...
That's life.
You know...
Look... confused...
Wow...
You're not REAL confused...
This is kinda terrifying...

I GOTTA RUN SEEYA GREENFRIENDLEE RUN SEEYA
ENCAPED
You're already dead...
You're already dead...
Don't worry about it...
She... died a second ago...
She was too late...
I can do this...
Just give up now and I will be on my own...
You know...
I'm gonna do it
I can't do it on my own...
I don't want to give up...
This happened nowhere near as fast as I thought...
I did it!
I did it! I'm not even mad.
Yeah...
You did it!
You're not doing anything here any better...
You are?
Yeah...
I'm kinda bummed out.
I never thought about it that way...
You're right.
I probably am.
I hope you learn how to be yourself soon enough.
I gotta get back to work.
Qrow?

You got any better clothes?
YES!!!
You both are in a casket.
A small golden heart.
Qrow's bowels are easy to reach.
A medium abode.
A large abode.
All of his money goes to charity.
A noble cause.
A large abode.
All of his money is going to charity.
A humble home.
All of his money is going to charity.
A chosen one.
Fires can break deserts.
Baron's Forts Are Floating Fish.
Duckinnies Are Going to Be a Dope In time, ducks will be grasses and make dogs out of her.
I'm sick of you wasting my time.
She was right about you.
They all were... alike.
Well... they're nothing like what I wanted.
Then you had to be so hard on her...
