======== SAMPLE 1 ========
F... None of this was even close...
Hrm...
Looks like the power is still out. That's good at least.
Things are looking up for our brave adventurers.
Heh, I guess you're right. Let's press on you silly mutt.
Mutt?! How rude!
That lightswitch frying must have killed the power...
Must have died while I was outside.
Must have died during the night.
Hey!
I know you're in the middle of playing this game right now.
Unfortunately it's in Early Access and some parts aren't done yet.
Thankfully the next area is mostly done which is a lot better than not done.
This means you get to explore it!
It also means most things won't work and a lot will be changed later.
I hope you like it anyway!
Have fun!
Did I...?
Maybe I did...
I don't know what I'm capable of anymore...
Now we all know the truth.
We're all on the same page together.
You're hurting me...
You've always hurt me...
I feel sorry for you.
All you've done is hurt everyone around you.
I wish I could help you.
No... You can't... I'm in control...
DO NOT TRUST THEM
I know you're there.
SHOW YOURSELVES!!!
The vessel is stronger now.
Death lays in its wake.
More trees for the forest.
More kindling for the coming fire.
Life flourishes in its wake.
Less trees for the forest.
Less shelter for the coming storm.
It has yet to choose a path.
It will in time.
Time is running thin.
Then it will start.
Born anew.
ANOTHER CYCLE
Who are you to judge anyway?
Shall we explain, dear sister?
Soon, dear brother.
How about now?
Are you prepared then?
It's time.
Break the mirror.
Hurt them? Yes Yes
Hurt them? You stopped yourself before. You can do it again.
Hurt them? Yes  Yes 
Determined to fail.
Yet unyielding in conviction.
A waste...
A different path.
It lacks conviction.
Unfortunate...
The influence is below it.
It sees the path ahead.
It may... in time.
A different path.
It's become temperamental.
Chaotic and malformed...
Yet the vessel nears completion.
Will this one break the cycle?
We will see, dear sister.
Of course, dear brother.
Not much longer, little one.
Not much longer.
It felt right at the time...
Maybe I made the wrong choice...
That's not what happened.
The more you hurt others, the more you hurt yourself.
I learned that from you.
That's not what happened.
I... hurt him.
I was blinded by fear and didn't recognize him.
Even then, it was wrong and I would do it differently given the chance.
That's it... just give in.
Arrogant child.
How about when you... murdered... Joe?
Remember that?
We all remember that don't we?
Do you really want to forget? No Yes
A fresh start for a heavy heart.
Continue
Forget
This is the start of every horror movie I've ever seen.
Emelio...?
WHAT HO, SQUIRE!
Are you ok?
NEVER BETTER!!!
You sure about that?
OF COURSE!
GO ON AHEAD AND FIND THE MATERIALS WE NEED!
......
I'LL MAKE SURE THE ESCAPE ROUTE BACK IS CLEAR!
....
I...
Long Armadillo Sigh
I have been injured, Squire.
I mean, that's pretty obvious.
You are most perceptive.
Don't worry about me. I can make it back home myself.
Ask if he needs help? He looks like he needs it. He can handle himself.
Ask if he needs help? He can handle himself.  He looks like he needs it.
Ask if he needs help? He looks like he needs it. He can handle himself. 
Are you sure you don't need any help?
Help...?
Yeah... help getting home?
I would be very thankful for that, Squire.
It's Lore.
What is?
I am, it's my name.
Then I would be very thankful for the help, Lore.
Let's get you home.
Alright, well... What are we doing here?
You'll need to find a Sunstone at the bottom of the mine.
What does it look like?
You
