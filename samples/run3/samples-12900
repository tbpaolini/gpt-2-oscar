Seriously...
It's fire.
Seriously...
It's not even a monster yet.
Maybe it is.
Well... maybe you're right.
I should probably stop caring so much.
It's just... hard.
This is her problem.
Let her solve it.
Give her advice? Stop wasting our time. We need to keep moving.
Give her advice? Yes  No 
That's life.
Wild, weird, and full of terrors.
Heh... You're starting to sound like Fern.
Yeah, maybe a little.
Dang, that's good advice.
The price for it was pretty high...
Yeah, it can get pretty busy.
But it's not never boring.
You just have to do what you think is best and not push yourself too hard.
You can't fix what you think you should do.
What do you want?
Well... I guess you want what's best?
Working out? No Yes
Sorry... I shouldn't be here.
Yeah but...
You do?
I'm sick of you wasting my time.
I'm sick of you.
You waste my time?
I don't care what you are. Get over here!
I don't care what you are. Get over here!
You squire...
Great. You'll need this basket.
First row on the left. Don't be late!
Here you go!
The cart is extra heavy.
The last row of desks.
The cart is extra heavy.
It's all shiny and neat.
It's all shiny and neat.
It's all shiny and neat.
He's too busy jogging to hear you.
Hey, I'm BUDDY.
You're not listening to me.
It's full of... tax papers?
Nope!
Get him the...
What?
I mean... you didn't even get a single tax ID.
Maybe I didn't want to.
That's not very nice...
Oh... Uhhh... Sorry?
Don't worry about it.
I mean... You don't have much in the way of stamina.
That's kind of messed up...
You're right. I'm sorry.
Don't worry about it.
Are you alright?
Yeah... I just feel bad about the eggs.
You almost made it!
Just have to keep in mind.
You're not ready.
Good thing you know what you're doing.
Hey, you made it!
Yeah... you almost made it!
Seriously...?
Nope!
What?
Don't worry about it.
Are you sure you don't need any help?
Nope!
Oh don't worry about it.
Sorry...
Don't worry about it.
Are you sure you don't need any help?
Nope!
Oh yeah... You were right...
Dang...
You're only going to make it worse.
Is... it really all her fault?
No...
You're right.
I'm sorry...
That's not my fault.
What...?
Don't worry about it.
Are you sure you don't need any help?
Nope!
Oh yeah... You were right...
Dang...
You're always going to make it worse.
Is... it really all her fault?
No...
You're right...
I'm sorry...
That's definitely not the fault of me.
What...?
Don't worry about it.
Are you sure you don't need any help?
Nah...
It's alright...
You didn't even hit him.
But you're already past defensive.
There is no stopping you.
It will not abandon you.
It will protect from the outside.
