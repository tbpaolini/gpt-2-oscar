======== SAMPLE 1 ========

It needs shelter...
Iron and steel...
No...
It will not survive...
Then no path will...
It will always be there...
Cha...
Wait...
Is this...
A Stone Cryptozoologist's Memory?
Yep... I guess I's seen enough...
Nice and before long...
This is going to be over...
You can't keep this up...
I'm not getting any younger...
I'm going to be dead serious -
HOW COULD YOU MAD ME?!
Well I'm glad you reconsidered.
I did your best for the world. I'm proud of it.
So now you're doing the opposite.
I...
You what...?
Forget about it.
I'm here to find happiness.
What...?
Forget about it.
Oh no...
I can't be more confused.
So what now?
You'll have to figure that out on your own.
Wait... what?
Look... I'm sorry.
It's nothing personal.
To think... I've had my share...
I'm sick and tired of seeing this happen.
It's almost over...
You're right...
I'm sorry.
The world's ending really doesn't seem right.
I agree with you.
I understand...
That's pretty alright.
Even if everything goes as planned...
I guess you're right...
I'm sorry.
Going back to bed seems like a bad idea.
We'll see you on the other side, dude!
Thanks, Lore!
No problem, Intern.
We can totally be friends again!
Well... let's get going then.
This is just a trick...
It has to be...
You didn't catch a single one?
Don't worry... I won't judge you!
No...
I did catch a few...
What did you catch?
A few pretty flowers.
You almost made it!
You actually took the flower...
Hold it tightly and close your eyes.
What... is that...?
Something painful. Something hidden. Gnawing its way forward.
I just gave it a little... push
A little... cause then it will go away.
Nothing...
It's alright if you don't want it...
Even if it is scary.
What is this?
I sent you to the dark side.
Come inside and have a little fun.
Have a good time, Intern.
Does it really have to be that way?
Maybe I let you down before.
Oh yeah...
Been here all my life and then some.
It's not the best...
Well you won't know until you try.
You told me to do this.
You chose to stick with it.
What...?
Why haven't you found the other half yet?
Why won't you kill the real one?
Why doesn't it feel this way?
Why is this happening to you?
I...
Why do you do this?
I...
I saw a lot...
It's your fault.
You did...
You didn't care about others.
We are all related and different.
You hate on memories...
You hate for a reason...
That's not a word...
That's a thousand different ideas.
You really are a monster.
So now you choose a painful path?
Yes...
Now that...
Why did you do this...?
Why are you apologizing?
It's going to be ok.
You're stronger now.
I...
You're not real.
What is this?
Nothing...
It feels fuzzy and sticky.
It doesn't even have a name.
What is this?
Don't worry about it.
I'm sure someone will get it.
Just let her know so we can get going.
Are you ok?
You sure?
I know it can't be easy being a monster...
Even though you're not really a monster...
It's alright...
You got this.
Just give in.
You got this.
You got this.
Don't worry about it.
You got this.
I'm sorry...
This is just a trick now.
It's not a game of chance.
It's a game of probabilities.
You're getting stronger. Don't give up.
I'm sorry...
This is just a trick right now.
I can't be honest with myself.
I'm sure someone will come up to me and do a physical fight.
It's your fault.
You did this.
You did this.
It's your fault.
I'll try not to remember and remember and remember and remember and remember and remember and remember and remember and remember and remember and remember and remember and need to go back to sleep
