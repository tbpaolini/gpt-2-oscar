We need to fill this up. Is it a fire sale or a football game?
It's a fire sale and it's filled with frogs. I won't reveal which.
I'm sure Joe can get them.
He's been saving them for me.

The ink sinks into the page and fades out. Your progress has been saved.
The couch looks incredibly comfy.
People come and go but there's always one change on the table.
Every couple of racks of department store sandwiches are going through change.
It's empty.
You know what?
You right, I'm glad to hear that.
Well... I'm glad I could help you.
No worries.
Good luck with your new venture!
Nice and neat.
What...
You never found them.
Good luck with your own venture!
Never thought I'd be interested in them.
Maybe I wouldn't be anyway.
Nice!
I'm ready!
Wait... what?
Take a minute.
Everyone takes minutes.
This isn't what it felt like.
I don't know...
You're not alone.
Not me either.
They all did but... nobody was hurt.
Why are they like this?
Why do you have so many sandwiches?

You seriously have nothing to say?
Just leave us alone.
Or what?
Or...
Or either way, this is what it looks like.
Well... I don't think I'm ready.
What do you mean?
You're getting tough.
I don't think I can catch a decent cold here.
Fine...
Please leave us alone.
Don't worry about it. I'm ready.
Is everything really me?
Oh yeah?
You're pretty me...
Yeah... I think I'm done here.
Alright...
I'm done.
I don't think I can catch a decent cold here.
Thanks...

Well yeah. You both are.
Nope.

You both made this mistake time... Oh well, you should probably get going.
You know what?
Go with it.
I'm not going to hide from it.
I'm not going to hide from myself.
Alright...
Good.
I gave you the choice.
Well... I'm not going to hide from myself.
Alright...
I'm not going to hide from you.
You know...

You're being impressive.
