Quickly, I'd better get going.
How unfortunate you...
Poor fool. He already has a camera in here.
You're weak... You can't even make it out alive.
How unfortunate you...
I'm almost there. Stand back.
Are you ready, dear brother.
Pathetic, you'll miss out on a lot.
Unfortunately Emelio.
Just keep moving.
Damn you, fer me or anyone else.
You were too generous.
We don't even have...
The hamfisted hand makes for a nice tie.
A shame, that guy was convicted of murder.
You're way too loose making this list.
All you do is slow down and stuff.
I'm sure more brothers like this will come out.
Thankfully I have the strength to handle you.
Little brother... You're weak.
I'm glad you understand the implications of what you have.
We can work out a better contract together, dear brother.
Of course, dear brother.

You'll note a few of my words here and there.
They're only contagious if used sparingly.
You're nothing like what I'm made of.
Don't worry, little one. We'll get going.
Stupid little monkey. Only uses sock puppets.
Hurt me then.
No, actually, HARD YEARS OUTS BEST!
You make an error dear brother.
Be gentle, little one.
BE CHEMICAL!
