======== SAMPLE 1 ========
I think we found a lost sock.
Stay out of it.
Keep your distance.
I don't know...
Nothin' like a good sock.
Keep your distance.
It caught our eye again.
Not stopping since we last saw each other.
Not stopping since we last knew each other.
What an awkward bunch.
Finally caught up to you.
Always wanted to hang out, but you got this.
I don't even like bills so much...
That's fine...
Just like... not doing anyway.
What an awkward bunch.
Finally caught up to you.
It was just a bunch of cash.
Wow, that was... weird.
NOW OUR QUEST HAS ENDED!
Hey, you alright?
OH! I... Yes!
OH! I... I should have paid more attention.
I just...
You know...
It can be overwhelming sometimes. Don't you have anything better to say?
No?
I...
I don't know...
It's nothing...
What?
If anything... hurt you, I, uh...
It's just... it's always hurting me.
Wait...
Is that... maybe?
Maybe?
Maybe?
Don't you...
You really think so?
Yeah... maybe.
I'm not sure if that's the right word.
It's fine...
It's nice.
It's not painful.
It feels good.
You know...
I'm sorry...
No...
I don't think I can do this alone.
I think I do.
Just tell me what kind of feeling it is.
I think I do.
I think?
What should Rhode do?
Vote for me? No Yes
In the morning?
You know what? She's real down here. Let's go!
She's real down here. Let's go!
Nobody.
The door is already heard around here.
Oh yeah?
Yeah... What are you doing?
I'm playing this dead.
Well, there you go.
Good to see you got any sense.
Damn clever.
You'll need to get some supplies later.
Seriously?
Oh... I have an urge to nap right now.
Alright you two, I'm going to need them.
Wait... what?
MEANWHEN YOU NEEDED HER?
Nah.
Anyway, let's go get some supplies then.
Seriously...?
Nah.
You're wasting time.
She doesn't care about you.
Seriously?
She doesn't matter.
You can't hurt her.
I'LL MAKE SURE OF IT!!!
It's here.
You're ready.
You got this.
Everyone makes mistakes.
Don't worry about it.
I'm not here to hurt you.
I'm not here to hurt anyone.
Well that's a pretty good warning before you head out.
Seeya, Nerdhire!
You're in my way.
Not the best for jokes though...
I said eat!'
You vouch for yourself.
I heard you done wrong.
You know what? Sure.
Everything's fine.
You're probably right.
But I'm not going to hide from it.
You're making a good point.
Yeah maybe not everything is... right?
Well if that's how you feel then I know you're on the right track.
I'm sure everyone has at some point.
What...?
Yeah... maybe you're right.
I should have listened to you.
Maybe I didn't want to give him the help I needed.
Maybe I should have protected him better.
I'm sorry, Universe...
I'm sorry too. This can't be happening...
It's your fault.
You did this on purpose.
You hurt him first.
I will always be wrong.
I'm sorry.
It's never too late to change.
Things can't be this bad.
You know what? They can.
They are... things.
They are... at times.
These are my attempts at humor:
Circhigold...
Circhigold...?
This is really funny...
Every page is full of... curses?
You know... you're not supposed to do this.
Keep going...
We don't even have all day.
The clock is starting to move today.
Toronto...
It's not like we have the gear on.
Is it really time like this?
I mean... this is really awkward sometimes.
Try as we may, there's never going to be perfect times.
Just best I don't get fired for doing my job.
You're right... I'm right.
I'm sorry...
Don't worry about it.
