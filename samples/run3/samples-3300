======== SAMPLE 1 ========

We have no right to give you advice. We live and die alone.
You're an animal and I have no jurisdiction.
There is only one Enlightening Heart and it is me.
Can you feel it?
Feel it swirl around you?.
You feel it? Oh yes.
No? Don't worry I'll try...
You feel like you're being watched?.
Maybe you're right... I just don't see the point.
Maybe you're wrong... I saw it...
Maybe you're wrong... I need to find a different path.
I disagree...
I know what I's doing.
I brought this on myself... You deserve it.
I don't know what you expected from that other than quantity.
Then you are the reason I'm here?.
If so, what are you?
If not, what are you?
You're being silly.
FIGHT THE MIGHTY!!!!
AND AXEL!!!
I found you...
I had better be by quickly.
What was I thinking...?
Did you just...
Something fishy...?
Something fishy.
You would think...
It took a little guessing on my part.
No...
I'm not a reptilian...
...or something...
Oh...
What do you mean?
Or is this really all of your fault?
Look...
You're clearly damaged...
I mean... You almost had my best shot...
But you're wrong...
You didn't miss either...
You unloaded the final shot just in time.
IEM GARBAGE WARNING!
You made this choice...
You didn't hit your target.
Not enough...
You almost had my...
You tried so many times...
But you didn't give in.
You jammed your body.
You chose this...
You let go...
But you still failed.
You know what...
You had to do it.
It's your fault.
I...
And you?
You're kind of a maroon to begin with...
What's the point?
Why are you here?
They're doing this to...
You a mole?
Can you be more specific?
I... I don't know...
That seems like a pretty bad excuse.
Aren't you almost there.
Grab the food pods and leave.
No more decisions here.
I'm almost there.
You a mole?
That's pretty messed up.
You a mole?
What's the point?
Everything to do with... you a mole?
What's the point?
You a mole?
What's the point?
You a mole?
You a mole...?
What's the point?
You a mole...?
What is this?
It's a slab of... metal?
That's it.
Let's roll.
You got this.
Picketing is illegal in U.S. cities. Do not fight, or else we will require your attention elsewhere.
Don't you wish we would have stopped you there?
Hehe...
What's the point?
Maybe you're wrong.
Check the water level?
Yeah... Probably not.
What happened next is completely up to you.
Drain all the trees and place the rest at the edges of City Hall.
Main street isn't much of a drive, so people don't have to make do.
A bunch of tinkering around.
It's kind of a big sticky mess.
The water is still in... well, it's not very nice.
Lots of phone numbers in here.
They all fill up my head.
Hey, you're in my personal space.
So, I'm a computer nerd?
Yep. Alright. Well let's do this.
This isn't what I'm talking about.
Look, I know stuff like that.
Hey, you're in my personal space.
Sorry...
Don't worry about it. Anyway... let's go.
Hey, you're in my personal space.
Sorry... Don't worry about it.
Recyclable...
Who... is this?
Wait... You're not supposed to know.
So now you're asking questions.
Could it be?
Maybe it's not real?
Who... is?
Who gave you the power?
I... what?
Let's get you a new one.
Looks like 4C is open! Right next to that weird shirt guy. Have fun with the rest of your career!
NOW YOUR CYCLE IS CLEARED!
WHAT A GLORIOUS TENSEFLAKE!
MEOW ME AGAINST MY BEST FRIEND!
FLORIDA MAN POWER!
I saw that...
Poor OScar. You could have done worse.
Why are you here
