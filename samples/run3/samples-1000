 boy... He's always been there for me.
Dad...?
You'll see, I know we're inbetween worlds.
What about tomorrow?
When you get to the other side?
When you both get to the same place?
That's never going to Bea... ㅠ
I'm really excited about today, kiddo.
Today is almost over but... ㅜㅜ ㅋㅋㅋ
I GOTTA TURN THAT ON IT'S ENOUGH!!!
Any time soon ㅋㅋ
Anyway... ㅜ ㅜ ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Your fault.
It hurts.
It hurts a lot.
It made you do all the thinking.
You're still not going to take enough of this.
You're going to get this.
You know why.
You know why.
It's not always easy...
You know why.
It was nothing like you thought it would be...
It's not even gonna be as bad...
You still don't know why.
You really do know why.
It's not even gonna be as bad...
It's just... weird.
You really do know why.
It's not even gonna be as bad...
It's not even gonna be as bad...
It's just... weird.
Ahh yeah, time to wake up.
Going to get up in the morning is kinda tough in my book.
Pfft.
Luckily for us, it's just a weirdo out of his usual places.
Pffff...
We've been assigned mostlyazardly sized trash.
You know... I'm just saying that when you actually have time to spare.
It's definitely got work doing the gifs at the end of the...
Nah.
Hey, dad?
Yeah, well you know, you know that.
Y'know... I think everyone in general is kinda like this.
Except for cats.
They make me feel good.
It's full of weird stuff.
Like... this beard?
Fantastic creation by TheWhiteChick.
This shelf is super strong.
It's fragile but the more it twists you can tell it'sened to a certain point.
Not going to mend it... She's still my sister.
Wait... really?
Well yeah, you say that out loud.
But seriously, dude... You were always supposed to be like that.
Seriously?
People get kind when you're too nice.
Also... This shelf is super stressed out.
I mean... It's not even a desert.
That's not even really what I expected.
Seriously...?
Yeah but...
This shelf is overloaded.
Is it really all going to be ok?
Oh man... I don't know what to do.
Maybe because of you.
Or maybe you know what you need?
Seriously...?
You both.
You both.
I.
I don't know.
Maybe you?
I don't know.
Maybe?
I.
Yeah... You both?
Yeah... Alright we'll see you around.
Anyway... This shelf is overloaded.
You both.
You both.
I.
I don't know.
Maybe you?
Hey... Hey
Hey Hood...
 and The Collector...
You know what? Let's go back to bed.
Because we want to see your rack.
Because you stole my rack.
Because you stole our rack.
You ask nicely.
And we feel good about this.
Maybe you know me?
Yes.
I.
You're not so nice?
...Uhhh...
Really?
Maybe I am.
Maybe I'm just different.
Maybe you're wrong.
It's not that deep.
It should have been a little deeper.
But it's not a little.
You alright?
Yeah... Uhhh...
Wow.
Are you ok?
Maybe a little?
You can't really say anything right?
Well, maybe a little?
No...
That's not very good of a response right?
Oh boy.
You actually wired my fist really, really well.
That's pretty awesome.
I mean... That's pretty awesome.
That's really awkward.
This is its turn to do business.
Hey, uh... do you want coffee?
Coffee is free?
I mean... I don't even know what that really means.
Don't worry about it.
You know... I'm just saying that.
You're right.
Yeah... You're wrong.
You really think so?
Maybe I'm just out of things to do.
Anyway... Come tell me what you need.
Does it have to do with coffee?
Nah.
What about now?
