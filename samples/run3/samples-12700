Does it have to be that way?
Well... not always.
It's actually kind of funny.
You're kind of scaring me...
Yeah... yeah.
Well, at least you didn't end up getting shot.
I mean... I don't mean anything by it.
You're just scaring me.

Definitely more industrious than Animus ants.
Dad...?
I'm sorry...
No, I should have listened to you.
I should have paid more attention to what was going on.
I just got so wrapped up in work that I forgot what it meant to be a dad.
I let you down.
It's fine...
It's not... but I hope in time it can be.
Please take this before you go.

I love you.
I love you too, son.

Pathetic...
You're not that impressive after all.
What was I thinking...?
You really caught a lot of food pods.
You really caught a lot of egg pods.
You planning to share?
I mean... we are FRIENDS after all.
You really caught a lot of those...
You know what...? It doesn't matter.

Does it?

Ikkens.
Every house has a knob or notty.
You can't even make it round.
Fern can. Sigh.
It's full of unfinished stories.
It's empty...
You just can't find what you're looking for.

You can't even make it round.
It's full of extremely rare plant seeds.
What...?
A little jingle says it all.
Well, that and the rubber duck is super cool.
What's the point?
You asked me and I'm good...

It's full of even more plant seeds.
What...?
A few scattered colored stones.

A few of these smell like chocolate.
A few of these taste like chocolate.
