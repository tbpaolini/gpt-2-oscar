======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 grow up and feed the rest.
This plant looks like it's growing in the sand.
It's a succulents flower but with some extra stuff.
Some extra stuff if you care about the succulent.
It's full of some really cool stuff.
My name was Terry. You chose a path that's scary.
This place just kinda goes on forever does it not.
You quickly seductively dismissed one of the flowers.
It's too dark to talk right now.
Hey, what's up?
I thought you wanted to talk to me.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
So, do you have a path forward for...
It?
A path that gets us where we are today?
My name is Terry. You're kind of a maroon.
Terry?
Yeah. What do you think about me?
What do you think about me?
What do you think about me?
Don't worry about it. Everyone is working on something.
I guess you're right.
Thanks...
I guess you're not mad at her?
No...
I'm sorry...
Good, now that you think about it...
What path do you want to follow?
What path do you want to follow?
What are your goals?
My priority is to become more than a zombie and stay alive.
I see...
So you're saying that being a zombie is your whole life?
That's a little too easy...
I'm pretty good at it.
You're not that impressive after all...
Still, be the hero of my story.
So let's go with that.
I guess...
Good, now that you think about it...
What do you mean?
We're both zombies and we both gained tons through hard work.
You're right...
I... I'm sorry...
I didn't mean to.
Let's talk about it.
How do we get back home?
From what I understand?
From where?
To your own...
Well yeah...
Well, that's pretty risky.
What do you mean?
Caveat: It's not my place to say it.
Alright... I guess you're right...
That's what I'm here for.
What...?
What do you mean?
You need to learn to live with regret.
You don't need to learn to live with regret.
I see...
You're right.
What do you mean?
You need to find a new path.
You need to find a path that works for you.
You really caught a few wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly
Fine... I'll try not to get tingley after all.
How do you feel? I can't fix your sleep apnea, but... it seems to be fixed.
Can you fix it?
I can, but it looks a bit trickier.
It may or may not be cactus land.
I can't say that I approve of all things cacti.
All things.
Fern most definitely.
Thanks...
Fory...
No... Fern is my...
No... No! Don't say that...

You found a snakey sock. Scaly!
You really caught a bunch of wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly wiggly
Heh... You're finished.
I guess?
What were you planning?
To see the future?
To look back on your past?
To think you could make it?
You know what...? Yeah, maybe a little.
I guess you're right.
I hope you learn the same lesson one day.
You're right... But, I'm telling you.
It's not always easy...
You really can't always make it.
Not every day is the same...
I am your champion.
I shall...
... defend you from the terrifying nightshade...
Every creature within 5' of you is cursed with shadow.
The surrounding has learned a thing or two over the course of the night.
They may see a lot of things but not all of them.
They don't always have to see all of you.
Living things do sometimes come to them from time to time.
It's called influence.
That's what matters.
Sometimes
