 Egg Salad
Delicious egg sandwiches on which to lay eggs. They're totally different than regular egg sandwiches.
I always love to hear what you think of the game. What do you think? Do you have a favorite part of Heartbound?
Let me know in the comments!
Have fun and don't forget to share!
Have fun playing Mirror's Edge! I'll be going over it soon!
Going to try out the new savegames? You can check out my new game: The First Time You'll Find Something You're Not Used to.
Go play with your friends? They have fantastic games to play. Not really a need for games, but it's not always easy to find a spot.
Go find a new job? Absolutely not. I want to make sure I'm being adhering to the law.
Go find the right one? Yes No
You're wasting time. Time is running thin.
Definitely don't have a job? Do you want to work?
I mean you should be able to do that.
I should be able to do that.
But... I'm not a programmer. I'm a jelly.
There's a jelly in here. Don't think it's real.
It's a numbers game. Print out the results and answer a few questions.
IK deck.
This is ridiculous.
You're wrong.
IK deck.
Uhh... What is that?
In a game of financial stability.
Alright... I think I'm done here.
You're wasting my time.
I need one more job.
This one's not real.
It's a bunch of silhouettes.
Lie to him.
He didn't lie to me.
Hack to name a few.
Try to ask about a friend's career.
Get them both to agree to disagree?
Disagree?
Definitely!
You're wasting my time.
I hate to say it but I'm a terrible liar.
I learned that from you.
I don't hate you either.
I just know you could have done it better.
That's the best I can say.
What...?
I don't know you, or Hawaii.
Look, I don't really know what to say...
Seriously... What?
You lied to me.
I lied to you.
I lied to you.
I lied to you.
You could have done it better.
Sure...
But I didn't. I was blinded by fear.
I'm so proud of you.
Going back to bed? Yes No
The lights are out. Go back to bed.
You seem refreshed. The night sky is dull.
You seemed out of sorts. All of this runningny soup makes me want to munch on it.
The sounds are coming from all over. Don't look back.
You're not getting any younger.
You're getting still.
There's a lot going on.
You're getting ready for work.
You should probably get going.
You should probably get going.
You should probably get going.
You're going to jail.
Yeah yeah!
Yeah yeah!
What was that...?
Time for your term!
You can't be a programmer when you're super sleepy.
Knew I'd gettin' boring soon.
Welcome to Future Spoilers...
I'm not a programmer...
Slip down? Yes No
Feed this monster time.
Feed this monster time. 
How many times do you need?
How many times do you need?
There's a lot of mouth to open.
