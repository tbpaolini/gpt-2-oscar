======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 too so I guess. Thanks.
Seeya soon, Intern.
A solid slab of cool metal blocks your path.
It's a bunch of haphazard trays with just a few scraps of paper printed onto the sides.
Where... Where am I...? There's a hand out here.
Paperwork done and gone. There's... nothing.
You quickly pick up the object.
A paperweight sits tidy in the drawer.
Great... nowhere to put it.
A small pile of books.
There's a ledger across the top. Strange symbols litter the pages.
There's a single stick of dynamite in here.
Yeah what I feel like...
You'll never learn, Intern.
A pile of books.
It's a bunch of hastily scribbled notes.
The robot is too busy jogging to hear you.
Hey Binder?
No worries. I need this to say hello.
You can't be here...
It's closed.
No more clues.
Uhh... hey there.
Where am I...?
There's a page with 'Project Icarus' written in red across the top.
A strange assortment of minerals and crystals.
Blinking lights litter the light poles.
It's a Tower Corp brand umbrella table.
It's a very quick boilers influence.
This toy maker family is extremely powerful.
Dad Dai is always right behind him.
And he's doing a terrible job.
Dad he's doing a terrible job.
Binder... Where are you?

It's nice here...
It's not really nice...
Foolish indecisive child.
Independent contractor! Wrong boss!
Man, you're like, really bad at this.
Eugh....
I don't know what you expected.
From what I hear, he's from the Future.
Heaven help you.
It's different here.
You're way too harsh.
It's not different...
CHEESE!!!
You're so harsh.
It's different.
You're still a mush and nothing!
It's different.
It's different.
It's different.
It's different.
It's different.
It's different.
It's different.
It's different.
It's different.
It's different.
It's different.
It's not different.
It's any different...
You are much too skilled.
To shout at the same time is beyond my abilities.
The power is too great.
Performance Artist Job! Year one has now passed and I'm not getting the urge to run.
I should have listened to you.
This isament that must not die.
It must save the world.
We are in agreement on that, Intern.
It must follow its masters path.
It should follow its maker's path.
Why does this even matter to you?
It's fine...
It's not... but I hope in time it can be.
We are in agreement on that, Intern.
Great, now we're apart of a bad thing.
Why does this even matter?
It's always breaking new ground.
We need to get going.
It's not our place to choose, Intern.
Heck yeah, that's pretty cool.
We don't have to follow your lead.
You're not supposed to follow yours.
I... I'll try...
Oh fine... OScar took me...
Don't worry about it.
Yeah... it's probably not as bad as you think.
Seriously...?
Oh really?
Yep.
Well, what do you want to do?
I know how you felt.
Just do it.
You sure?
I said, do it.
Hey... if you're good you'll be good.
Why do you have to do this?
It's just a trick... isn't it?
It's a memory...
It's not real...
We can only guess anyway.
Well, guess?
Honestly... don't do this.
You actually did this...?
No...
you didn't know.
Well maybe you did.
Hey look... this.
This is really his back.
You know...
A little manipulation is not a good look.
He was probably 6 years old when this happened.
When I asked my friend what he wanted to do, he said play with his toy.
That's pretty messed up kid.
