 trees.
A ledger sits on a cool smooth stone.
Record the journey so far? No Yes
The ink sinks into the page and fades out. Your progress has been saved.
At least this place seems comfortable.
Rest in the soft grass? No Yes
It's a deer sock. Someone must really love it!
Hey, Newhire.
You know, you're really not supposed to be here.
I get it though. You want to know.
Life is like that sometimes.
Going places we shouldn't go.
Getting answers we don't want.
Just one endless search through the void.
What... you're still here? Don't say I didn't warn ya.
Take this... Don't tell him I sent ya.
00000000
Take the A E S T H E T I C? No Yes
Better leave this thing alone.
Vaporcave Is Dead.
It's way too A E S T H E T I C to touch.
Long Live Vaporcave.
Miranda's the name and fishin's my game!
This hat is glued to my head. That way I'm always cool, even underwater.
Bottlenose?! Don't harsh my cool, man.
I wonder what aesthetic tastes like...
Do everything with porpoise. Then we'll always be friends, dude!
Can't hear you, Intern. Come around the front.
It's too bright to talk right now. Just gonna close my eyes and relax instead.
Oh hey, you found them.
Yeah, here ya go.
Good work, Intern. Time for your next job.
Not this again... You sound like OScar.
Neat. Here's a dollar. Get me a coffee.
Seriously?
Seriously.
Get Joe his coffee? No Yes
No.
No?
No.
Hey Whistler?
Hey Joe.
The kid doesn't want to do his job.
That's pretty unfortunate, Joe.
You're lookin' a little sweaty there. You sure about this kid?
Are you sure about this? No No
Alright, fine. I can do that.
Good, catch you later.
Ugh... fine I'll do it.
That's the spirit, Intern.
I don't see any coffee.
Oh hey, you brought it.
Yeah, here you go.
That's fine. I don't even like coffee.
Keep the change. Get yourself a drink. You deserve it.
......
Oh don't look at me like that.
....
Bah, fine. I'm sorry. Lemme teach ya something in return.
Ok, this better not be a trick though.
Do you know how to whistle?
Nope.
Alright well, scrunch your face up and blow.
.....
Uhh... A little less... all of that.
.................
There ya go!
Hey... thanks, Joe.
Any time, Intern.
Another day. Another dollar. Another coffee.
Can't seem to get their attention.
A sharp whistle rings out across the... water?
Hey.
Uhh... hey?
Small stripe need a thing?
Small green need a thing?
What kind of thing?
Pool Pal Paul will show.
Yeah, alright...
The strange liquid is calm and unmoving.
Hey, thanks Paul!
Yep yep, bye!
Hey, you heard any good rumors?
Yeah. I heard about a guy who asks too many questions.
Oh yeah? What's his name? I gotta know the details.
You tell me.
Come back when you have some juicier rumors.
It's the most massively useful thing in the universe. Shame someone left it here.
This bench looks extra comfy. You could take a nap if you weren't on the case.
It's a Tower Corp brand umbrella table. There's a little tag on it... 'Keep Away From Raccoons'.
Can't hear you, Intern. Come around the front.
Oh yeah, don't use your newfound skill near the pool.
Why not?
Just trust me, Intern.
Hah, bold move.
Well, OScar did say I'm bad at following directions.
Your funeral, Intern.
That was a close one...
Enjoy shiny, tasty stripe.
Enjoy shiny, tasty green.
Tasty...?
A small golden heart. There's a picture inside of a younger man with glasses. He looks familiar.
A deliciously painful memory is tied to that object.
Where are you...?
Wherever I like.
Well... nobody said you could talk.
Stop me then.
I... I don't know how...
Good. Embrace that helpless feeling.
Now pick up the object.
Alright...
