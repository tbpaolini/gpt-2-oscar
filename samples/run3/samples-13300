======== SAMPLE 1 ========
What are you working on?
How do you want to talk about...?
Why do you seem... isolated?
I want to be with someone else instead.
Wait... What?
You really want to be with her?
I want to be with her as she goes on her own as if nothing has happened.
Why do you think she's gone?
Why did you miss...?
I never thought about it that way...
Well maybe you should start.
What do you mean?
So you were trying to get those ducks?
Yeah... I guess?
Let's go to bed then.
What about when you helped her get up?
She didn't help at all.
Of course I did.
What...?
What about when you helped her get up?
She's good now.
I'M READY!!!
Gamble in my merry horsey, dad.
OH BOY! What's on the other side?!
It's Gamblers Noodle Salad.
Dad...?
What's the matter...?
We just met but you didn't notice anything.
I should have.
What about now?
I can't fix this.
Well you won't know until you try.
That's not very nice.
You never learnt anything from that.
Oh wow, look at the wrinkles.
This is what I wanted.
Ira handed me this book and I like it so much I'm going to give it to you.
I never thought I'd be interested in it.
You're a chameleon.
You're a chameleon.
I'm a weird assortment of strange and wondrous.
You don't have any money.
This thing only has a coin slot.
The coin pops into the slot as the machine whirrs to life.
There's a pair of sunglasses in here.
Hey, bring those over to me at the pool. I need them for... work.
It's empty.
That's sensitive stuff. Top clearance only.
The screen is covered in sensitive stuff. You don't have the clearance to read it.
That's sensitive stuff. Top clearance only.
Hang in there! You're contractually obligated to keep going! -The Management

Potential! You have the tools to make your boss look great! -The Management
That's an old man cactus. They have super cool beards.
Who you callin' old, kid?
You, and that's a FACT!
Dang kids and their dang facts...
The key looks like solid gold... but it's just a cheap toy.
A deliciously painful memory is tied to that object.
Where are you...?
Wherever I like.
Well... nobody said you could talk.
Stop me then.
I... I don't know how...
Good. Embrace that helpless feeling.
Now pick up the object.
Alright...
Hold it tightly and close your eyes.
What... was that...?
Something painful. Something hidden. Gnawing its way forward.
I just gave it a little... push.
Find more like this. I want you to feel the rest.
Not enough... I need more...
Another out of place tome. The nearby plant doesn't seem to mind.
Record the journey so far? No Yes
The ink sinks into the page and fades out. Your progress has been saved.
The couch looks incredibly comfy. Nobody will notice if you take a nap, right?
Sleep on the job? No Yes
Dude, can you stop doing that?
Nah, being lazy is half the fun.
Well... what did you need me for anyway?
I like you kid. You got pizzazz.
So...?
So, I'm gonna help you out.
What's the catch?
Just a favor. Something harmless.
Sound good?
Not like I have a choice...
That's the spirit.
Check the whiteboard for a password. You'll need it for work.
Oh yeah, one more thing. Don't do anything my buddy Whistler here wouldn't like.
He can get pretty... direct... if you know what I mean.
Pleasure to meet you. I look forward to working with you.
Seeya round, Intern.
Seeya...
