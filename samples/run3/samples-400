I hate you, Smarty.
I really do.
Until then, I hate you.
I hate myself, Smarty.
I feel bad for you, Smarty.
This is not how this works.
You don't win the battle and go home.
I love you, Smarty.
It's a love letter to your dad. I won't lie to you.
I know you will but I believe in you in the end.
He didn't deserve this...
What do you mean?
I chose him anyway.
I have feelings for him... but not all of them.
This is life after all.
He won't feed you. You can't leave.
I gave you what you chose. I know you are weak.
It must be really hard being away from home so long as you stay.
Yeah well I guess this is the part you think I should get going on.
Are you sure you want to help? Shelly
I can't really speak to her... but I can tell you her pain.
Don't worry, kid. Shelly is doing ok.
Alright. What do you want? I need help.
I can't help but feel bad for you...
I need to help you but not her.
So what?
We can go, I'm sick of you wasting time with your troubles.
This sounds horrible I tell myself.
You're hurting me... right?
Of course and I won't back down.
I hate you for it... but...
You didn't realize?
You're right... maybe I'm wrong...
Don't worry about it... I will give you everything.
I don't know if...
What?
How do you know?
So what happened to Emelio?
Did you really think up a plan like this?
I mean... what was my idea?
What if it worked?
What if Emelio helped you?
What if she didn't?

I...

Don't know.

You don't seem to mind...

I guess...

I just need some help.

This is not how life is supposed to be.

You're making me feel... painful...

That's not what this feels like.

You're not making me feel any better.

You're making me feel even worse.

Look, I know I can help.

You're making me feel less than, kind and compassionate.

How do you feel?

You feel terrible and you're hurting me.

What did you just say to me?

I asked you and you said no.

So what happened to Emelio?

I told you how it turned out.

You're right... maybe you're right...

Maybe Emelio really wasn't that bad when he happened.

Maybe Emelio really wasn't that bad when he did.

I just...

Filled my heart with fear and hurt.

I just...

Filled my heart with hope and hope is nothing...

Why do you ask?

Why do you need to be so kind to so many...

A little... help?

Where are you...?

Where are you today...?

Why don't you come back with something nice.

What was that...?

Why did you do this?

Why fight me?

Why take my place?

Why fight me...?

Why fight me...?

Why fight me...?

Why fight me...?

Why fight me...?

Why fight me...?

Why...?

Why...?

What're you doing...?

What are you doing...?

I have a medical issue and I need medical help.

What are you talking about?

I just found out about you.

Who is that?

I wanted to ask you.

You don't have a question...

This is ridiculous.

It's your fault.
