======== SAMPLE 1 ========

It's filled with garbage.
The Viking Feast pours from the can into the trashcan. A tiny axe shaped meat clings to the side of the bin.
Why would you do that...? Has it really gotten that bad?
This isn't like you... It can't be...
The Viking Feast brand dog food sits gloomily at the bottom of the trashcan.
Denied its destiny the trashcan recoils in sadness.
Hey Lore?
Yeah what's up?
Just wanted to say... I had a really good time today.
Yeah me too. Let's head back to bed, alright?
Sounds good buddy.
Hey Lore?
Yeah what's up?
Today seemed kind of off... Is everything alright?
Yeah... Sorry for being a maroon...
That's alright... We can both be maroons sometimes. Let's get back to bed, ok?
Hey Lore?
Yes?
You're kind of scaring me... Is everything ok?
Of course. Why do you ask?
N... no reason...
Take the axe? Yes No
Getting ready for a Viking LARP? I won't judge you...
Strike fear into the hearts of trees and terrors alike.
Baron's Collar...
He must be close by...
Don't worry buddy... I'm on my way...
It's torn to shreds... Blood for blood...
It's torn to shreds...  
You found a wet sock. Slimy!
Finally paying attention are we?
Took you long enough...
Just a few mistakes here and there.
Nobody will notice... right?
Leaving just one flower...
You're pretty messed up. You know that right?
You just can't help yourself...
What an animal.
Cat got your tongue?
I... don't know what to say.
Well, that didn't stop you before.
What do you mean?
You really wanted to dig... didn't ya?
You barely knew her.
What are you talking about?
Rhode, ya dingus.
You never talked to her.
Yet you still tried to give me advice.
Well... yeah I guess.
Why?
Why did you give Fern advice? I wanted to help. I wanted to know more.
Wait... really?
Yeah...
I wasn't trying to be a maroon. Sorry if it came across that way.
Huh... that kinda changes things.
Seriously...?
Yeah...
You do realize how messed up that is right?
I mean... maybe?
You're wrong.
What...?
I talked to her before we went to lunch.
She clearly likes you.
Liked...
What...?
Where do you think we are?
What do you think this place is?
She LIKED me...
And now she's gone...
We both are...
This is your fault. You wanted to hurt her. I told you this would happen.
This is your fault. You're right...  It's not my fault. 
Wait... really?
Well I mean... yeah.
None of this would have happened if I wasn't here.
Seriously...?
All of this and you really think you're not to blame?
Well it's not the first time.
When I asked you for advice you just avoided the question.
Of course I did.
What...?
I don't know you, or Rhode. At least... not really.
How could you expect me to help you?
Well that's new.
When I asked you for advice you lied to me.
You acted like you didn't know anything about Rhode.
Except... she told you how she felt.
What's the point?
Why'd you lie?
Why did you lie about Rhodes feelings? I wanted to stay out of it. I wanted to know more.
It's not that I wanted to lie...
I just don't know either of you well enough to say anything.
I didn't want to give you bad advice.
You seriously have nothing to say?
Just... give me a minute.
Fine...
What about when I helped you?
What do you mean?
You asked me if you should follow your heart.
I told you it was a good idea.
Yeah well...
You should have stuck with your gut.
My gut?
Yeah dude. You were right... You told me to go with my heart.
But then you second guessed yourself...
Of course I did.
I don't know you, or Rhode. At least... not really.
How could you expect me to help you?
You know... you're not wrong.
You also kind of suck.
What...?
When we went to lunch you didn't help at all.
You
