 Should do it. 
Do you know what that feels like?
You should go. 
Yeah, fine. I'll just close the distance.
Well... where did you think you'd go?
I'd say... buffalo?
Why'd you want to bother?
It's just a memory!
What if anything golly me?
Put it away!
What if anything actually did happen?
What if someone saw my... What if something didn't go as planned?
That's a lot of detail to get a good picture of a camera body.
Ions of film grain is best if you're talking in warm water.
Typical for Watercolor Space Marines.
Typical for Watercolor Sun Be Heons.
The camera goes dead in one shot.
This little thing is really old fashioned.
Cyanide bezels look nice and thin.
Typical for Watercolor Space Marines.
Typical for Watercolor Bezels.
They're too beautiful to see again.
I get what you're trying to say...
It's not always easy going through times.
However, sometimes... things can be made all the harder.

This newbie part is the staple in my nightmares.
Disgusting.
The Fiber Matrix says to make it the new ally of the strong.
Yeah, totally fair.
Except... they don't make it there!
What's the catch?
There's a bunch of weird looking sticks sticking out of a bit of twisted matter.
I notice they're a bit too long for my banana stump.
This stump seems to be making a comeback.
A bunch of twisted old fashioned stuff sticking out of my stump.
This isn't what I wanted. Not anymore. Not with me.
Look at how tough he is.
Booby trapped in a stump for over a year.
Formerly pretty, but still pretty.
Eatin' rabbits... hard work was had to be had with passion.
Amazingly unbeknownst to the rest of us, the farm handmill is actually a family favorite.
An ancient dark blue plant.
When we look at it we look rather sad.
It might be around 50 years old...
It's still a red eye green.
We know you're into farm handjobs. Let us know what you want!

A record of every recompense made to you by anyone who has worked with the repairer.
A nice, handbag ready worker.
You are the Future! Worker!
It's nice to meet you. A good night's sleep.
There's a bunch of them: a copy of The Art of the House, a box of coins, and a small key.
The coin picker is out of coins.
The key picker is in the slot machines.
There's a tiny nunchuff in there. Guess it's a rat.
These things are tough but tough.
The farm handjobs are a ridiculous lot.
They have spiky webs on their heads and toes.
Those are my claws!
Definitely your best guess.
I don't see anything wrong with that.
Don't take anything from me.
I'm pretty sure you're right...
Yeah, it's not my strength at all.
What are you looking at?
A hard landing.
You probably shouldn't be here.
At this time of year? You're never too different.
Look at you.
This. This new.
Don't you have any food?
You shouldn't have to make this.
It's cold. Unseasonable.
Look at you.
There we go, all the way into the night.
Not that it's a big deal, but sometimes it's not always in your best interest.
I'm gonna come help you.
Good.
Take care of yourself.
Not the world. Not the world.
Have fun.
Heck yeah I do.
You're welcome.
I'm not sending you... food.
I'm sending you... a friend.
They all went to war. And you.
Yes.
It's something to learn.
I know.
It doesn't matter either way.
I know.
It's not what you do that matters.
I see.
Good, now you decide.
I'll try not to get involved.
Wait... what?
You want to help?
I want to help? :D
You told me to help.
You know what?
 Yes.
I shouldn't have.
Anyway... Thanks.
The door is just gone... You should have
