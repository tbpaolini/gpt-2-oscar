WORKS DONE!!!
She may be small but she can sure yell loud enough...
I HEARD THAT!!!
Wh... what's going on?
Wait... She's gone...
Just like the others...
OH NO!!!
Bluhhhh...
OH MAN... This is bad...
Flurrrghhh...
OH CHEESE... He hit the ground super hard...
Nyuhhhhh...
OH GOSH... He's totally gonna die...
Clearly there's only one solution...
TIME TO BLOW THIS GUACAMOLE STAND!!!
It's full of... socks?
You can't even wash them. There isn't any soap.
Can't... turn... away...
This toaster looks like a champion.
About the right size for a head.
Turn on the stove? Yes No
Great now it's a fire hazard.
Everything in here has gone bad.
Collect the trash? Yes No
Garbage mountain once stood here.
Obtained a can of Viking Feast brand dog food.
Nice! That's my favorite one!
Nothing to put in the bowl.
Feed Baron the Viking Feast? Yes No
Feed Baron some of the Garbage? No! Yes, I am a terrible person.
Feed Baron? Viking Feast Garbage
The glorious Viking Feast pours from the can into Baron's bowl. It has little axe shaped meats in it.
I always wanted to be a viking. They're so cool.
Heh, I'm sure. Hurry up so we can get going.
I'm already done!
What?! How did you finish so fast?
WITH VIKING POWER!!! Let's go finish our adventure!
He made really quick work of that.
The garbage slumps into Baron's bowl with a disappointing wet sound.
Hey... That's pretty messed up Lore...
I didn't expect this from you...
The sickening mush glistens in the bowl.
Hey! Where are you going? Don't leave yet...
Don't do this to me... Come back with that!
The can is over on the counter. I would open it myself but... paws and stuff.
I'm ready! What's the flavor of the day?
OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH
Still need to grab the garbage.
It won't turn on...
Well at least it isn't a fire hazard now.
He's not here...
What was I thinking...?
Looks like the power is still on. That's good at least.
Things are looking up for our brave adventurers.
Heh, I guess you're right. Let's press on you silly mutt.
Mutt?! How rude!
That lightswitch frying must have killed the power...
Must have died while I was outside.
Must have died during the night.
Hey!
I know you're in the middle of playing this game right now.
Unfortunately it's in Early Access and some parts aren't done yet.
Thankfully the next area is mostly done which is a lot better than not done.
This means you get to explore it!
It also means most things won't work and a lot will be changed later.
I hope you like it anyway!
Have fun!
Did I...?
Maybe I did...
I don't know what I'm capable of anymore...
Now we all know the truth.
We're all on the same page together.
You're hurting me...
You've always hurt me...
I feel sorry for you.
All you've done is hurt everyone around you.
I wish I could help you.
No... You can't... I'm in control...
DO NOT TRUST THEM
I know you're there.
SHOW YOURSELVES!!!
The vessel is stronger now.
Death lays in its wake.
More trees for the forest.
More kindling for the coming fire.
Life flourishes in its wake.
Less trees for the forest.
Less shelter for the coming storm.
It has yet to choose a path.
It will in time.
Time is running thin.
Then it will start again.
Born anew.
ANOTHER CYCLE
Who are you to judge anyway?
Shall we explain, dear sister?
Soon, dear brother.
How about now?
Are you prepared then?
It's time.
Break the mirror.
Hurt them? Yes Yes
Hurt
