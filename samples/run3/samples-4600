Don't worry about it.
Are you alright?
Yeah, yeah I'm really sorry.
Thanks.
I understand... if you're gonna go, get me something else.
No problem, take my keys.
I'm the manager. The door is on my way out.
That's a Fact... Fact!
What did you just say?
I'm not a monster...
That's pretty messed up, dude.
Oh yeah, you should check out the salamander.
That's kind of rambunctious...
Yeah... it is?
Make sure to take a nap if you take a nap on the job.
You're getting stronger. Don't give up.
You're going to be better.

Hey, you alright?
Yeah, sorry... Just kinda phased out for a minute there.
Hey, don't worry about it. We all deal with things in our own ways.
We don't have to live our lives.
Just... do ours.
So... what do we do?
I take everything in.
I say this... Don't worry about it.
You alright?
Yeah... maybe a little?
Everyone gets its share.
You know... just keep in mind something.
Keep in mind?
Yeah... maybe a little?
Everything in this place.
Yeah... maybe a lot.
You know... maybe a lot.
Yeah... maybe a lot.
Yeah... maybe a lot?
Yeah... maybe a lot?
Nothing you do do that bother you.
Maybe a little?
Yeah... maybe a lot.
Hey, you really want to know that?
You know...
Well, there it is. Just leave us alone.
Say what you want.
What do you want?
What do you want?
Here it is. Just give it a minute.
Hey, you think I'd leave it alone?
Yeah... maybe a little?
Just want to know what you think?
Think about yourself.
What do you want?
Think about what you want.
That's pretty awesome.
Hey, don't worry about it. Be the hero of your own story.
Just think of the havoc it would cause.
What resources would be better?
None.
Hey, don't worry about it. I'll try Cubeleon if...
What should we do?
What should we do?
What should we fight for?
Who?
What are you fighting over?
Aldon.
Aren't you tired?
I mean... The Compression Wars Are Going To End In This Place.
We need this.
What are you fighting for?
Is this what it means to be a hero?
Or is this what it means to be a mole?
Give us a chance.
What should we do?
I don't know...
Well... give them the option.
Well... give them the choice.
I think they're ready.
Well, they're out of batteries.
How long is too soon?
This thing is way too easy...
Don't give up.
You can't do this.
We all are but you can't fix this.
You can't fix every nook and cranny of this world.
Imagine how messed up that would be.
You'll never learn.
You're right.
We are.
How do you feel?
I feel bad.
I did my best.
It was never my choice.
I'm glad you reconsidered.
That's the spirit.
Message in a friendly brown mail.
Let me know if you need help getting to the top.
That's pretty rad.
Give them the nod?
Yes, student...
No problem.
What do you mean, student?
I said give them the nod.
Think twice before backing off.
What do you mean, student?
I... I don't know how...
Keep this in mind.
I'm not an expert.
Yes I am a little biased but there is no need to bring it up.
Alright then...
What should I do...?
I'm sure everyone has at least one...
What should I do...?
I'm sorry...
Just don't
