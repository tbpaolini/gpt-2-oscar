======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 a small pocketwatch resting on a pile of books.
The edges of the pocket watchwork are sawn in. There is a small hummingbird in here.
A large stone whale blocks your path. It's highlysectile and endangered.
This stump is too hard to work out. It's a spider stump.
It's a stump? What an old man.
Good at hiding...
Nah, that's much appreciated.
The snake is still nursing a bite wound through its eye.
The old man here is getting ready to leave. He looks rather scolded.
Cliffshade can be reached at catherine.clofthewa.com. We look pretty decent together, kid.
If you need help getting up, they have a Jar of Artifact in here.
Boof... Boof...
He's out of batteries. Not much longer.
One sec, out of the way.
The clock is called out to you. It is only a clock in crisis.
Disappointed Not right now. Time will do that for you.
Oh wow, you've seen that whale!
Yeah, not again.
Good, cover your ears. Don't be shy.
He's smaller than a football. Gross!
You're still able to read due diligence.
I guess you're right.
There's a lot that's worth saying.
Don't want to appear like you didn't know what you were doing?
Well thanks, Lore.
You're welcome.
Thanks?
Yeah... I guess I'm right about that.
Last chance.
Find more food pods. Get more food pods. Gotta get them.
NOPE!
Just get them somewhere private.
You're pretty much done for today. Just got your ducks.
Hey, you got any good ones?
Alright, that's quite a haul.
But, I'm right here in here.
I'm not a veterinarian.
What...?
I'm not a veterinarian.
You're wrong.
You're doing this wrong.
Hurt them?
Make them pay.
Make them pay? Shelled and Dizzy.
You're right. Unfortunately.
Expecting people like you to be veterinarians.
Do you think you can help them?
How do you know my ducks?
You asked for it.
Then I would be wrong to make you an enemy.
Why do you keep asking?
You don't know.
Perhaps I do have experience but that's no reason to think this one can go on.
You will understand when it's over.
Weirwood
I'm sure you will. I believe in you.
That's the spirit.
We shall see.
In time, I hope to be the best.
I know you will.
In time, I hope to be helpless.
I saw what you did.
I won't let you do this.
I won't let you fail you.
I did my best.
It was flawed.
But then...
It changed.
You can't change what you did wrong.
You can help others by making them feel heard.
In times of need, it will do so despite the challenges.
-The Mindbound Turtle
A fragment of a brother.
A strange offering to those with mindfrightening powers.
It's time to get rid of the affliction.
It's not about to light a path of discovery.
You are not ready.
You are.
Lore?
I left this world to help others.
Not to help myself...
I don't know if I can do this alone.
None of this does it say in the plan?
Maybe I can do this?
I head for the mirror.
Ey buddy, mirror is all frayed and tattered.
I look up to you.
Wash my hair, dude. You're not supposed to be here.
Oh hey, you made it here anyway.
Yeah, sorry.
Good, thanks.
Now I'm out of here.
You know what?
You liked what's wrong.
I guess you're right.
I just know you could have done it better.
Maybe I didn't know what I did had I known what I did.
That's not very nice...
You have some very brave acts today.
Stay home with me, dude.
You know what?
Liked it.
Not much longer.
You might be right but I hope you know your stuff.
I know what you want.
That's probably a good advice.
Man, you're like, really bad at following directions.
You're like, really bad.
That's kind of messed up...
Just don't forget to have fun.
You're like, you're like, really bad at following directions
