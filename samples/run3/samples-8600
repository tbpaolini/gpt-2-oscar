======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 too...
Anyway... Meet you back at the house.
Sure thing.
Oh, and Lore?
What's up?
Thanks.
Yeah, no problem.
It's been busy.
You again...
This one knows us, dear brother.
It may not wish to, dear sister.
Well, you're right about that.
How unfortunate for it.
We shall see.
In time.
I don't need your pity.
Hello again, little one.
You again...
It recognizes us, dear sister.
It matters not, dear brother.
You don't get to decide what matters.
It has passion.
Without conviction.
We shall see.
In time.
I don't need your judgement.
It has fire.
Yet no spark.
It will not survive.
There are other trials.
One that starts here:
There are other trials.
Thank you, dear sister.
A stone with... blood on it.
No... it'll protect itself.
One that justifides in terror.
No...
It may yet choose to listen.
We shall see.
We shall.
An overwhelming desire to succeed.
It showed a mastery of form and function.
An adept student of the hunt.
Will it continue?
We shall see.
We shall.
That's enough.
Another powerful response.
Backed up with compassion.
It wished to spend time with her.
A proper choice.
It may have chosen for its own gain.
I disagree, dear sister.
Your disagreement is noted, dear brother.
Another powerful response.
Yet lacking compassion.
It chose to leave the path.
Not helping her is not compassionate.
It pushed the envelope.
Not telling the truth is.
It may have chosen out of malice.
We agree.
We do.
Another powerful response.
And full of malice.
It does not care for others.
It wishes to hurt them.
A fine choice at times.
I disagree, dear sister.
Your disagreement is noted, dear brother.
I SAID THAT'S ENOUGH!!!
You sure? You seem kinda down.
It was given a choice.
One of friendship or self indulgence.
It thought only of itself.
A fine choice.
It chose to think of her.
Unexpected and unhelpful.
I disagree, dear sister.
Elaborate, dear brother.
It needs compassion to survive.
Not telling the truth is.
It chose to think of her.
Unexpected and unhelpful.
It needs compassion to survive.
Not telling the truth is.
It chose to think of her.
Unexpected and unhelpful.
It needs compassion to survive.
Not telling the truth is.
Neither was it chosen for its own gain.
I disagree, dear sister.
Elaborate, dear brother.
It needs compassion to survive.
Not telling the truth is.
It chose to think of her.
Unexpected and unhelpful.
It is.
Neat.
I agree, dear sister.
Good, now we're apart.
Why did you even want to...
I don't know...
How could anyone give you anything...
Maybe you could have helped her.
Maybe you're just... scared...
You've been hurting ever since...
You younglings always hurt.
You thought you could just move on?
Nothing.
There is another one...
Look, I'm not smart...
I've seen worse...
But there's no denying it.
You can't change what you've seen.
Take a minute? Like a zombie?
Don't feed me... How am I supposed to feel?
Not after all of this...
What can we do?
After all of this?
Don't you want to hang out?
Look... I need you to do the talking.
I need you to do the telling.
Hang out? No Yes
Hang for only a bit?
Then we can get going.
So... what do we do now?
We need to leave...
ODA... the house...
Hmpf...
You comin' or what?
Who do you want to follow? Shelly Sheldon
Not much longer.
You'll see soon enough.
Nobody asked you.
Yet here we are.
The door is gone...
Lore...?
Dad...?
You can't be here...
Dad, Baron's hurt...
I... I can't let them do this... I can't let her find you...
What are you doing...? Stop... I nee...
You need to leave... NOW!!!
WAIT!!!
I SAID GO!!!
Baron...?
This
