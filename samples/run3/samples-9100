izellular?
Yes.
I don't know what you went to try to do...
I just know you could had it if you wanted.
Hey Newhire, the elevator is on your... own... path?
Is that all you've got?
Uh...
I'm not here to hurt you.
Wait... what?
I don't know you, or Rhode. At least... not really.
How could you expect me to help you?
You know... you're not wrong.
You also kind of suck.
What?
You're not trying to be friends?
Why do you keep falling into things?
Because I'm BOSS?
Why do you hate me?
Why do you hate me? What...?
Ugh... fine. I don't really know what I'm doing.
Gross dude.
Hey newhire, you're doing fantastic!
I've been pretty decent to you.
Always eager to work on myself.
Working on myself. Not at all like you.
Why are you doing this?
I should have listened to you.
I should have paid more attention to what was going on.
I just got so wrapped up in work that I forgot what it meant to be a dad.
I let you down.
You're right. You did.
I'm sorry...
Hey, dad?
Yes?
Nevermind...
The door won't open for hardened criminals like you.
It's locked and nobody seems to be answering.

There's a small key in your pocket. 'T' in red space.
Hello?
Yes.
You may open this if you feel right.
Relax. I need to get ready for work.
Yeah, work.
Disagreements happen sometimes. You just have to be better than this.
It's kind of hard for me to tell someone else than myself sometimes.
Not sure how that works...
Your skill with the watch is par for the course.
What...?
IY!!!
HER!
She works so hard she can afford a top hat.
Then she does awesome!
Tower Corp is an open job! Everyone gets a chance to shine!
I'm glad you understand that.
How do you know my name?
I'm best friend number one.
Hello Lore?
Yes?
Like... the same one?

Well, nothing fancy.
Filled with things that need to be fixed.
Now we're at the bridge.
Looks like 4C is open! Right next to that weird shirt guy. Have fun with the rest of your career!
I'm curious about the watch. How long will it take?
As long as it takes.
Is it done yet?
Are you done yet?

Then neither am I.
