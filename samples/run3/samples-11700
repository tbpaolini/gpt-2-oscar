======== SAMPLE 1 ========
It's already finished.
That's a FACT!
The door rattles but the lock isin' awesome.
Uhh... I'm new here... not locked... Uhh... I'm new here?
You're welcome.
First job for you. Find five ducks. Bring them here.
I never thought office work would involve this many ducks.
Not enough ducks. Need five ducks. Go get ducks.
You got the ducks. Good.
Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck... Goose? Why are you like this?
Go talk to G8r. Work is done here. Thanks for ducks.
Hey Newhire, isn't this music groovy? Come back when you're done and stuff.
Little busy right now. Go see if Phish needs anything.
Wait... you actually found them? You can't be serious.
It took all morning to hide those ducks. Now he's never going to shut up about them.
Hey G8r, I got my ducks. If you need one let me know.
Ugh... he's already starting.
Anyway... I take it you're the Newhire then? You're doing fantastic work so far kid.
Thanks...?
In fact I have an extra special job for you.
Alright, what do you need?
You know that machine covered in stickies out on the floor? Go get me one.
Just any of them?
Yes.
Seriously just a random sticky note?
Yep.
Fine I guess... back in a minute.
Seeya.
Hurry up, Newhire. I don't have all day.
Wow... You look ridiculous.
You're clearly too skilled to waste your time here in IT. Talk to OScar for reassignment.
Go see OScar. We're done here.
Wow... You look ridiculous.
Thanks...
Definitely too ridiculous for this boring job.
Let's get you set up in a cubicle! That's like, way more fun... right?
Let's get you a new one! That's like, way more fun... right?
That really doesn't sou...
Looks like 4C is open! Right next to that weird shirt guy. Have fun with the rest of your career!
Go play with your food! Second row on the left. Don't be late!
Your new job is in the Mailshroom! First row on your right!
Seriously?
Also, take that thing off your face. It's company property.
The screen is dark and unresponsive.
Thanks for ducks. Ducks make me chuffed.
A rack of blink blanks.
A rack of blinkity blanks.
A rack of blinky blanks.
A rack of blank blonks.
A rack of blankity blonks.

A rack of blonk blinks.
A rack of blonkity blinks.
A rack of blonky blinks.

A rack of... ribs?
Hey stop looking at my racks! They're private...
Hah, you look silly. Good joke.
You're almost there. The Artifact is just up ahead. Be careful Lore...
Wait... Something's wrong...
Binder what's going on?
I understand now... 
LORE GET OUT OF THERE!!! IT'S ALL WRONG!!!
I'm scared... make it stop!
We need this to save him...
RUN YOU FOOL!!!
Hey!
Sorry to say that's all we have right now.
The rest of the game isn't finished yet.
It will be soon though!
Thor, Shaye, and Stijn work on it every day.
Thor should probably sleep more but nobody can stop him at this point.
I REALLY hope you like what comes next.
Anyway... See you later!
An ant sits on the edge of the planter.
Visions of yourself in a labcoat surrounded by ants swirl in your head.
The ant managed to escape while you were deep in ant based fantasies.
A planter filled with lovely well-kept flowers and not even a hint of ants.
These smell like chocolate? CHOCOLATE?! CHOCOLAAAAAAAAAAATE!!!
A faint hint of caramel wafts through the air.
These flowers smell absurdly delicious. Your mouth waters at the very thought of them.
You quickly devour one of the flowers. It tastes like sawdust and sadness.
Eat one of the flowers? What could go wrong? That's a pretty bad idea.
It may smell nice but it tasted nasty.
It may smell nice but it's probably not safe to eat.
Hey... did you need something?
Sorry! I was just looking for someone.
I uhh
