======== SAMPLE 1 ========
.
I really tried...
It's not anything like home...
You're right, dear.
Of course I did.
What?
You're right...
I'm just saying this because you need my help?
What...?
Yes?
You're missing something important.
Help them find him.
What if he's gone?
What if I'm to blame?
Why do you think I'm here?
Why is this going on?
It's not my place to tell it to you.
What should I be doing?
What should Fern do? Follow your heart. Better just play it safe.
She's going to get hurt.
It's your fault.
That's it.
Push her away.
Have you tried telling her?
No...
Maybe you should start there.
What if she doesn't like me back?
What if she does?
What if she doesn't feel the same?
I... I don't know?
That would probably ruin everything...
That's definitely a tough one.
Yeah...
Well, we should probably get going.
Well... we should probably get going.
Ahh yeah, time to stop lazing around.
You think Fern is done with the watch by now?
I wouldn't put it past her.
She's pretty good with her hooves after all.
Anyway... Meet you back at the house.
Sure thing.
Oh, and Lore?
What's up?
Thanks.
Yeah, no problem.
It's been busy.
You again...
This one knows us, dear brother.
It may not wish to, dear sister.
Well, you're right about that.
How unfortunate for it.
We shall see.
In time.
I don't need your pity.
Hello again, little one.
You again...
It recognizes us, dear sister.
It matters not, dear brother.
You don't get to decide what matters.
It has passion.
Without conviction.
We shall see.
In time.
I don't need your judgement.
It has fire.
Yet no spark.
It will not survive.
There are other trials.
There are other cycles, dear sister.
You are correct, dear brother.
Burning with passion.
Yet without control.
It may yet hone the blade.
We shall see.
We shall.
An overwhelming desire to succeed.
It showed a mastery of form and function.
An adept student of the hunt.
Will it continue?
We shall see.
We shall.
That's enough.
Another powerful response.
Backed up with compassion.
It wished to spend time with her.
A proper choice.
It may have chosen for its own gain.
I disagree, dear sister.
Your disagreement is noted, dear brother.
Another powerful response.
Yet lacking compassion.
It chose to abandon this one.
Yet not the other.
It may have chosen out of malice.
We agree.
We do.
Another powerful response.
And full of malice.
It does not care for others.
It wishes to hurt them.
A fine choice at times.
I disagree, dear sister.
Your disagreement is noted, dear brother.
I SAID THAT'S ENOUGH!!!
You sure? You seem kinda down.
It was given a choice.
One of friendship or self indulgence.
It thought only of itself.
A fine choice.
It chose to think of her.
Unexpected and unhelpful.
I disagree, dear sister.
Elaborate, dear brother.
It needs compassion to survive.
Not all vessels do.
We shall see.
In time, we shall.
You're not listening to me.
It demands to be heard.
It begs for attention.
A natural response, dear sister.
We cannot speak on its nature, dear brother.
We will, in time.
We will.
Yet it pushes others into isolation.
An ideal unknown to us.
The thought has appeal.
You overstep, dear brother.
My apologies, dear sister.
You know what? Fine.
I'm sick of you wasting my time.
Hurt them.
Make them pay.
Make them pay? You don't have to do this. Don't let it control you.
Make them pay? Yes  Yes 
It is denying the influence.
This vessel holds promise.
A foolish mistake.
This vessel is not ready.
Shall we test it?
In time.
Until then...
Farewell, little one.
You will understand when it's over. This is for the best.
That will not happen. Not now not yet.
We can fix this
