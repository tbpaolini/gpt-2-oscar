You're going to need it.
Just give it a shot?
You're wasting time.
We the People.
You're wasting time.
It tastes like chocolate.
It feels like it's been compressed.
It feels like it's been compressed.
It tastes like it's been compressed.
It tastes like it.
It starts to rain.
You can't see it.
It's too dark on the outside.
It's too dark on the inside.
I'M READING SQUIRE'S BATTLE ON THIS FOR A MONTH!
I can see it now.
It's bright and clear.
I'm NOT READING THE CRACKING!!!
I'm not READING THE DOUBT WHATEVER YOU ARE!!!
It's too cool for words.
Delicious food and flowers. Trust me, you knew that was coming.
I'M NOT READING THE CRACKING!!!
IT'S ALL IN DOUBT?!
It's nothing...?!
You don't have any passion.
You're wasting my time.
Is this even you?
YOU DON'T HAVE A DOUBT?!
It's alright... I'm not a monster.
It's not funny...
I'VE NEVER SPEAK!
TGFO!
Oh yeah?
Yeah.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
So... what's going on?
You know my... my memory is too... wrong...
I don't know if I can remember...
That's not a bad thing...
Well... let's put it that way...
You and I could go one day...
That's definitely a good idea.
You sure?
Yeah... I'm kind of scaring you but yeah, not that kind of creeped out.
You're kind of scaring me too...
Well yeah, maybe a little different.
So... what now?
You go get breakfast?
Yeah... no.
Well, I don't have much time.
I should have paid more attention...
I should have paid more attention...
I should have paid more...
Better not break the law.
Alright...
No...
Don'tSealTheBoots() again.
Nope.
This one gets really hot.
You never break the law.
Nevermind...
You did a pretty good job.
Looks like the power is still on. That's good at least.
Things are looking up for our brave adventurers.
Heh, I guess you're right. Let's press on you silly mutt.
Mutt?! How rude!
That lightswitch frying must have killed the power...
Must have died while I was outside.
Must have died during the night.
Hey!
I know you're in the middle of playing this game right now.
Unfortunately it's in Early Access and some parts aren't done yet.
Thankfully the next area is mostly done which is a lot better than not done.
This means you get to explore it!
It also means most things won't work and a lot will be changed later.
I hope you like it anyway!
Have fun!
Did I...?
Maybe I did...
I don't know what I'm capable of anymore...
Now we all know the truth.
We're all on the same page together.
You're definitely smarter than me.
Maybe you're right...
Maybe I'm totally wrong.
We can get back on track together. I believe in you.
Thanks for playing Heartbound!
You're wasting time.
He took a lot of damage from the front.
Thor is faster than me.
He can out run you. Just not as fast as you'd like.
I'm glad you turned down the chance.
You're a hero.
You're false.
I would have stolen it if I didn't take it.
Just waiting for someone to say a certain number.
Beat them? Guildwork is waiting for you.
It's called propaganda by the time you reach the bar.
You's Human. They're all messed up. All over the place.
What... you're not talking burgers and mutts.
He was right.
You're just a pawn.
You're getting stronger. Don't give up.
I'm with you.
I'll try to be better.
I know you're right.
I've still got your back.
They weren't enough.
I'm not enough.
I can't keep them.
I don't even have much left.
You just have to do what you think is best.
What... you're still alive?
I... don't know.
That's kind of messed up...
Well... yeah.
That's what I'm here for.
What...?
You
