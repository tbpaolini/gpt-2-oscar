======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 you can't be serious.
The kid didn't know what he was talking about.
He's-
You're pathetic.
You could be so much more.
It doesn't matter how ridiculous. You can't change what happened.
Just look around.
BAM!!!
You're safe and in my library. Enlighten me on what a viking is?
Might as well get going.
I really think I needed this place.
The floor is rough and I don't have a locker.
There's a smooth metallic object in here. It's the back of the locker.
It's smashed closed and can't be opened. It looks like it took hundreds of tiny punches.
The locker stands sockless before you. It seems lonely.
Working out with a buddy makes things pretty easy.
Especially when your buddy is as quick as Chomper.
Gives me something to shoot for.
Working out with a buddy makes things pretty easy.
Especially when your buddy is as slow as Trapper. HAH HAH HAH!!!
Oh yeah? Well, I'm catching up!
IMPOSSIBLE!!!
He's too busy jogging to hear you.
He's too busy running to hear you.
The bracelet feels cheap... like painted plastic.
A deliciously painful memory is tied to that object.
Where are you...?
Wherever I like.
Well... nobody said you could talk.
Stop me then.
I... I don't know how...
Good. Embrace that helpless feeling.
Now pick up the object.
Alright...
Hold it tightly and close your eyes.
What... was that...?
Something painful. Something hidden. Gnawing its way forward.
I just gave it a little... push.
Find more like this. I want you to feel the rest.
Not enough... I need more...
Home at last.
WHERE AM I?! WHAT IS THIS?! WHERE IS BARON?!
You're safe and in my library. Enlighten me on what a viking is?
The locker stands sockless before you.
Thanks for ducks. Ducks make me chuffed.
A rack of blink blanks.

A rack... nid...?
A rack of... ribs?
Hey stop looking at my racks! They're private...
Hah, you look silly. Good joke.
You're almost there. The Artifact is just up ahead. Be careful Lore...
Wait... Something's wrong...
Binder what's going on?
I understand now... 
LORE GET OUT OF THERE!!! IT'S MY QUEST!
That's not a bark... It's real...
I'LL MAKE SURE OF IT!
You sure about that?
NO!
YES!
I don't know...
Well when you figure it out let me know.
Alright I do, but I don't know how to tell her.
Ahh yeah... that makes sense.
You ok...?
Don't worry about it.
What should Rhode do? Follow your heart. Better just play it safe.
She's going to get hurt.
It's your fault.
That's it.
Push her away.
Have you tried telling her?
No...
Maybe you should start there.
What if she doesn't like me back?
What if she does?
What if she doesn't feel the same?
I... I don't know?
That would probably ruin everything...
That's definitely a tough one.
Yeah...
Well, we should probably get going.
Well... we should probably get going.
Ahh yeah, time to stop lazing around.
You think Fern is done with the watch by now?
I wouldn't put it past her.
She's pretty good with her hooves after all.
Anyway... Meet you back at the house.
Sure thing.
Oh, and Lore?
What's up?
Thanks.
Yeah, no problem.
It's been busy.
You again...
This one knows us, dear brother.
It may not wish to, dear sister.
Well, you're right about that.
How unfortunate for it.
We shall see.
In time.
I don't need your pity.
Hello again, little one.
You again...
It recognizes us, dear sister.
It matters not, dear brother.
You don't get to decide what matters.
It has passion.
