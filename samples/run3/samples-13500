======== SAMPLE 1 ========
's not anything like home...
You can get away with it.
You new owner is definitely not my type.
You're wrong... You can't be here...
I'm sorry...
Oh... Uhhh... Sorry...
Don't worry about it. I'm here to help.
Uhhh... Sorry...?
Don't worry about it.
Oh yeah... You still need that pocketwatch fixed...?
Yeah actually.
Alright... hand it over and lets get crackin'!
YOU GREAT FOOL!!!
HOW COULD YOU RAISE ARMS AGAINST AN INNOCENT?!
Uh... Emelio...?
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?!
EMELIO!!!
WHAT?!
I... Uh...
Disappointed Armadillo Noises
I can just go. You seem a bit... occupied.
I'm not going to let you hurt me again.
Wait... Please tell me what you require.
Are you sure?
Yes... I have failed you twice already.
Alright... Ramul told me to stop by and ask you about fixing this watch.
A noble quest...
WE WILL LEAVE AT ONCE!!!
Wait... we?
With you as my squire we will conquer this challenge.
Uh... squire?
QUICKLY NOW!!!
How do I keep getting into these situations...
A strange offering to untold entities.
A shrine to Misery and Mania.
A petty offering to false gods.
Simple tools worn from years of use.
A masters tools, worn with years of use.
Ancient and dusty tools. Why would anyone use these?
A strange assortment of minerals and crystals.
Fantastic treasures from untold adventures beneath the earth.
Dust collectors litter the table.
Crystalline structures fill the two stones.
These would look really pretty with the right light on them.
A few colored stones sit on the shelf.
A bunch of small parts waiting for Emelio to use them.
Tiny pieces waiting to be part of something greater.
Bits of trash leftover from projects.
Half-finished projects and tools are scattered around.
It looks like Emelio's tinkering around with new ideas.
None of these things are even close to finished.
It seems to have lost its light.
A unused lamp waiting for a firefly.
Long since burnt out.
It's a big slab of bedrock.
It's a comfy looking slab of bedrock.
An old dusty stone with a pillow thrown on.
You're breaking the law just looking at this bed.
It's a super hot forge. Not a very attractive one though.
The forge is bright and ready.
The leaping flames have died down.
This old anvil has a smudged out name on the side. Something that starts with A and ends with E.
This must have taken hundreds of blows from Emelio's hammer. It's still in pretty good shape!
A lump of cold metal.
Thank you, Lore.
You're welcome.
So... I take it the thing we need is in those caves?
Correct. North-East from where I was felled in battle.
Wait... battle?
OF COURSE! ONLY A MOST INCREDIBLE WARRIOR COULD BEST ME!
I'm sure... Get some rest and stop pushing yourself so hard.
I can handle our... noble quest... while you recover.
As long as you are able of mind and body.
Well... I'm off to explore a cave to fix a watch in a village full of talking animals.
So yeah, I'm pretty good.
REST COMPLETE! MY BODY IS READY!
Pained Armadillo Noises
Uhh... are you alright?
WORRY NOT! THESE WOUNDS SHALL NOT BEST ME ON THIS DAY!
ALWAYS LIVE NEVER DIE!!!
INTENSE ARMADILLO WHEEZING
Alright, that's enough.
BUT THE QUEST!
But, nothing. I can handle it. You can sleep.
BUT!
I SAID SLEEP!
INTENSE ARMADILLO SLEEPING
A simple rack for simple tools.
So... The Sunstone is at the bottom of the mine?
LORE!
I'M READY TO REJOIN OUR CAMPAIGN!
It's finished.
TO THE MINES, SQUIRE!
Emelio...
TALLY HO!!!
EMELIO!
Yes...?
Play along? Become the Squire. No more games.
Last chance.
Make him pay.
Hurt him.
Fix your mistake.
Pathetic.
That's it.
Keep going.
I HAVE COMPLETED OUR QUEST, M'LORD!
You... have?
HERE IS THE
