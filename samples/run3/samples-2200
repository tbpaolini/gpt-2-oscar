 about what you've done.
It is your duty to find him.
We here at The Tower see no compassion for those we love.
If you wish to leave our clutches, you must do so alone.
We believe in you.
We see no compassion for those we love.
As long as you work together you will be brought to...
We will bring you bring you to Truth.
No...
No...
I can't be here...
It's too dark...
Where am I...?
You... doing this in the first place?
Yeah... I think I'm done here.
Oh yeah, one more thing.
Don't do this on me.
I'm not your enemy.
What...?
Don't worry about it.
How about when we met?
That's pretty cheesy, dude.
It's not... funny.
I don't know,... maybe.
Look, I know how hard things can be.
It can be pretty... hard sometimes.
You know... just keep moving.
I believe in you.
No...
No sure...
This is it.
This is it, am I truly the best you can be.
This is what works best.
You're right... I believe in you.
You thought it came down to it?
No.
Was that... you or not... are you ready for it?
What are you waiting for?.
You... ready for what...?
It's name is after a snake.
Yeah that's a nice addition!
How do you know it's my snake?
I'm not even wearing a hat.
...
That's pretty shady of you.
... Is it really a snake?
You think so?
Obviously. Look I'm keeping an eye on you.
So, is it really a door combination or are you helping me?
Make up your mind.
I'm keeping an eye on you.
Yeah, that's pretty shady of you.
... Is it really a snake?
You betcha! *giggles nervously*
You're right... I am?
Yes.
What do you mean?
My book is in my lap. I know you're mad at me for stuff I said, man.
You're right... I'm sorry...
It's yours, you developer.
It's yours, too...
You're right... I said I'm mad at you.
It's yours... well... I'm sorry.
It's yours... well... I'm sorry.
It's yours... well... I say sorry.
Yes, I know that.
It felt wrong... but hey, you were helping me.
Hey, don't do it.
Hey, don't do it.
Impossible to take... but it is?
Imagine... or anything...
You made the right choice...
It could have been a lot worse.
I'm glad you took the time to learn those first few lessons.
She was right about you.
They weren't really my fault.
I was right about the first one too...
You're wrong.
It's not my fault.
I was right about the other. It wasn't supposed to be like this.
Oh yeah?
Well, I'm glad you took the time to learn how to cast Stoneskin.
You're welcome here.
What course of action should I take?
First, head out to the water's edge.
Second, learn to hide in plain sight.
Finally, find a spot in the crowd that doesn't involve you.
I understand now how you feel.
That's it! Don't worry about it.
You know what to do.
Just leave me alone?
Nope.
Fine...
What if I don't want to go?
Then I'm going to go...
What if I don't want to go?
Who would want to live under such a oppressive environment?
Producer Position
-You alone are capable of saving the day.
First, find a comfortable position in the team.
Then, find a comfortable position in the crowd.
At this point you're only capable of helping Seeker B if you're assigned to her.
This will obviously limit your influence with the next cycle.
However, given the nature of your replacement weasels are of course animals.
So... how do you go about going?
Lose some weight. Become more proficient with the earth.
Hey! I'm the Animus. What is that?
You may know me as Squire OScar, but I actually run a small business.
If you don't know who I am, you should.
I'm pretty good at hiding behind my ambiguous reputations.
Barnacle.
What's this?
Like, seriously... come on.
