It's Pauliny Day.
No special events planned for this house.
The buck stops moving when it's hit by a hammer.
This thing never stops making jokes about how tough it is.
Except... he makes fun of it.
Except... he doesn't.
Except... he needs to hear the truth.
Except... he really, really needs to.
Except... Gave it a bit of love?
It didn't give a fuck.
Oh yeah?
You're bad at this.
You know what? Fine.
I'm sick of you wasting my time.
Hurt them.
Make them pay.
Make them pay? You don't have to do this.
Make them pay? Yes  Yes 
It's over.
This place is.
The handpicked workers of this strange shifting world.
You know... I don't think I'm good at this kind of thing.

You go on...
It isn't my place to tell it like this.
I may be wrong... but one day I hope it is.
You're right... I told you was the best question.
Well, thanks.
None of this would have happened if I wasn't here.
Seriously...
You're right... I'm sorry...
Don't worry about it.
Uhh... what is that?
Bah... doesn't matter.
You sure?
Yeah... I'm out of here...
Hrm...

Now I'm off to hunt on my own.
Wait... what?
Hope you find what you're looking for.
So you changed your mind huh?
Yeah... sorry.
Don't worry about it. Come sit down!
This isn't what I wanted...
You're kind of scaring me... Is everything ok?
It's going to be ok. I believe in you.
Ughh... what was that?
You got hit in the head with a fishing pole.
Who threw a fishing pole?
Clearly nobody here.
Anyway... CATCH IT! CATCH THE THING!
Man, you're like, really bad at this.
Eugh....
I don't know what you expected.
Maybe I expected you to be less sarcastic.
Then you expected wrong.
Did you seriously just miss?
Nope.
So you were trying to get those bones?
Definitely.
You weren't trying to catch the fly?
Nope.
Gross dude.
You're gross, dude.
Nah.
Wow... that was kinda grim.
I mean... it's not the worst thing I've seen here.
What's the worst thing...?
Don't worry about it.
At least it was quick...
It's not always quick...
What...?
Don't worry about it...
Hey... you alright?
Yeah sorry... just thinking about something.
Your friend Baron I take it?
How did you know...?
Don't worry about it.
Oh no...

Did you just throw a shoe?
Nah...
Who throws a shoe? Honestly...
Couldn't be me.
Wait...
