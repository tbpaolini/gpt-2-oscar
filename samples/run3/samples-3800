======== SAMPLE 1 ========
oon?
My dad brought me to this bar a long time ago. He's a dear old father figure.
Welcome to The Toad Shop. My hat is barf... silly me!
The lady next to me is a little nervous. I will explain when I'm finished.
Oh, and by the way, is that trifle enough?
Sure, dear. I'll keep that place tidy.
How am I supposed to do that?
With style.
Then how are you?
I'm Finecake. I'm his... and now he's gone...
How could you expect me to help him then?
Clearly, dear.
So you were helping him?
I was helping him. I'm not even mad.
You...
You don't look so helpful.
Just a bunch of silly jest.
Dude...
You're making a lot of sense.
Really?
My coat has a picture of a smiling face on it.
A picture that just so happens to be stolen by Baron?
It has the words 'Baron Bialycoine' on it.
That's a picture of Newhire blood?
Yep.
So you had blood on your hands?
I did!
So you actually took those?
I don't know if I did or not...
I will say that when Newhire friends get a bit too rabid.
The fight breaks out when you try to steal it.
You don't have any money...
This thing is real...
You got these hands...
You have no idea what I've done.
What do you mean?
You got these.
Ahh...
Well, I'm not even mad.
In fact... I'm pretty good at this.
So you actually took those?
Yeah, all of them.
How much did you have?
No...
You don't know what you're doing.
Just enough to keep you awake at night.
You think you caught a bit of the... stuff?
I don't know...
What...?
Oh...
Think about it... You could ask your highness.
Imagine what you would have done.
You're right...
It's just a dream...
You will be right.
I've never seen it or heard from it.
Oh...
It's not real?
It's just a dream...
Oh well, you really got going on then.
With Fern.
About the People.
About the People.
Not enough...
It's all wrong...
You should have told her.
Havana...
Can you fix it?
Yeah... sure.
How do you know?
I gave you my time and I've definitely seen it.
Yeah...
I should have listened to you.
Hrm...
Better just stayed put.
I'm not ready for it.
What...?
You seriously have nothing to say?
I don't need your complaints.
Anytime.
I need to know what's going on.
Sit anyway you can, ok?
I mean... You can be a bit harsh on Twitter for being a bit of a maroon.
No...
It's alright if you don't give it ourosition.
We don't have to agree with each other on every detail.
What...?
You're right.
It's good to waste time each time.
It's not bad...
You know what...?
Yeah... maybe you're right.
I'm wrong.
I originally thought you were glued.
You're wrong.
It really doesn't matter.
Did I?
You're wrong.
Oh yeah?
You thought I was right?
Yeah... maybe you're right.
Did I?
You're pretty good at hiding behind your covers.
You're still not good at hiding behind your covers.
You buttver than to the death.
Terrifying huh?
Yeah... I'm sorry, Tad.
It's not fun looking at unexpected consequences.
It is twisted with secrets of its own.
What do you mean...?
Things are going well for the Baron family.
They've always been about him.
They always will be.
He still needs to grow his shell.
Perhaps he is now.
He's just a child.
He can make out clearly here.
Especially when he's running...
Wait... what?
You can't... see into his dark side.
He's still conscious...
This is just an experiment.
The light won't get seen.
Definitely more intense...
I warned you. Don't do it.
The light won't get seen.
You only learned this by looking at it from your house.
This isn't wrong.
I noticed. You're right.
I'm sorry, Teddy.
