======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 I're glad.
You're welcome.
So... I take it the thing we need is in those caves?
Correct. North-East from where I was felled in battle.
Wait... battle?
OF COURSE! ONLY BATTLE UNDERSTANDED MY STRANGE PLEIACAL MEANINGS!
I'LL MAKE SURE OF IT!
It doesn't matter how hard you try.
You can't hurt anyone else.
I AMNESTY! The things we need are...
The most powerful being on the face of the planet.
A pathetic attempt at a newspaper.
A clever newspaper owner.
A happy couple.
A couple that desperately needs coffee and one that neither wants nor cares about us.
We're both fine together...
Things are looking up for our brave adventurers.
Heh, I guess you're right. Let's press on you silly mutt.
Mutt?! How rude!
That lightswitch frying must have killed the power...
Must have died while I was outside.
Must have died during the night.
You found a smelly sock. Gross!
Are you ready to proceed? Not yet... I'm ready.
The chain falls apart in your hands.
The last piece. Finally.
Sit in darkness.
You're weaker than him.
Lacking conviction.
Weak as ever.
No... it can't be her...
It's time to get out of here.
You're right, Newhire!
Luckily, I've been instructed to open these doors for you.
What's on the other side...
Paperwork and a bunch of sad stuff.
I see you found a bunch of strange stuff.
Elaborate... but I'm sure everyone in here is pretty good.
Not even Faceless can stop him.
Hurt them...
Oh yeah?
Yeah, that's my pick.
Can't say that I like you either.
What?
You know what?
What?
You're right.
Maybe I'm a bit of a maroon...
Don't remember the last time I checked...
You're right...  Yeah, that's my pick.
Well... it's not the first time.
Neat thing I want to check it out.
Really?
Yeah, seeya.
Nice!
A ledger sits on a cool smooth stone.
Record the journey so far? No Yes
The ink sinks into the page and fades out. Your progress has been saved.
At least this place seems comfortable.
Rest in the soft grass? No Yes
It's a freshly laundered sock! Now you can trade it without getting caught.
Hey buddy.
I know you're hurting right now.
Just trust me when I say it's going to be ok.
You can beat this and I will be right there with you every step of the way.
Things could have been... different.
More like... everything else.
Maybe you're right...
It's alright if you're scared after all.
Just... don't give up.
This is how it should be.
You know what?
I'm right...
I'm just a pawn.
This is nothing...
Clarity takes time.
It's not often you see it...
It fades out of view.
You don't have to pass.
You.
It's not important to you.
Just tell me.
I can help.
I can fix this.
It's your fault.
You did.
I am sorry...
You're not supposed to be here.
What is, if anything... wrong?
Just let me fix it.
I feel sorry for you.
You're not supposed to feel right.
Everything is going to be ok. Just keep moving.
Wait...
Am I... the bad guy?
Is this really all my fault?
No...
 .
 ... .
You... You almost had me...
Just one more mistake...
I would have been gone.
Wait...
Am I... the bad guy?
Almost did die...
That's pretty brutal to watch.
It's not even close.
No...
It's not bad...
Just a few bad jokes thrown at you while you're in motion.
Don't worry about it.
Are you ok?
You seem kinda... sweaty.
TOTALLY FINE!!!
Uhh...
I DEFINITELY DON'T HAVE A CRUSH ON HER OR ANYTHING!!!
You sure about that?
NO!
YES!
I don't know...
Well when you figure it out let me know.
Alright I do, but I don't know how to tell her.
Ahh yeah... that makes sense.
You ok...?
Don't worry about it.
