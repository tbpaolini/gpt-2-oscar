.
I won't let you hurt anyone.
NOT NOW!!!
NOT EVER AGAIN!!!
You fight like a rabid animal.
Just give up now and I'll make this QUICK.
You can't keep this up...
I DEFINITELY can.
This is nothing...
YOU ARE NOTHING!!!
YOU'RE USELESS!!!
YOU CAN'T HURT ME!!!
NO!!!
I won't let you say a word.
I WON'T LET YOU SPEAK!!!
This doesn't matter.
I can stop you.
I can FIX this.
Is that all you got?
To think... I was afraid of YOU.
Why... why won't you die?
This isn't... how it was supposed to be.
You...
You didn't even move.
Wait...
Am I... the bad guy?
Is this really all my fault?
No...
 .
 ... .
You... You almost had me...
Just one more mistake...
I would have been gone.
You know that though... Don't you?
You're just waiting for an opportunity.
I won't let you have it...
That was close...
Though... not close enough.
It's time for me to make this right.
I can do this...
I can fix this...
That was too simple...
To think...
Things could have been... different.
If I just did this sooner.
It wouldn't be like... this.
Thanks for the life lesson.
You know...
I'm not even mad.
I did my best...
It just wasn't enough...
I wasn't enough...
I almost had you...
You know that though.
Don't you...
You did this on purpose...
Just to make me feel like I could make it.
Just so you could taunt me.
I...
Thought... It would hurt more...
It doesn't feel like anything.
I don't... feel anything...
This...
Whole time...
You were just playing with me...
I didn't stand a chance...
What are you doing...?
Why are you hesitating...?
Why won't you kill me...?
It's my fault...
What...?
IT'S MY FAULT!!!
All of this is...
Everything that happened to all of you.
I chose this.
I don't even know why.
But I chose this...
You did...
You can't fix this.
You can help others though...
Do your best.
It was just a puppet.
You took away the strings.
You can't escape your fate.
I do enjoy watching you try.
So that's it...?
So that's it then...
So that's it...?
What was that...?
You can hit harder and you know it.
Couldn't even do it in one shot.
Pathetic...
Still not enough.
Stop wasting my time...
Is that all you got?
Hit me again. Go on...
She was clearly holding me back.
You're the BEST.
You're probably right.
No reason to remember her NOW.
She didn't deserve this...
None of them did...
You really are a monster.
So now you choose mercy?
No...
You're just playing with me.
After everything...
You still choose to take more...
You really are a monster.
What...?
Why would you miss...?
No...
This is just a trick...
It has to be...
You didn't catch a single one?
Don't worry...
I won't ABANDON you.
Not even one?
Pathetic...
Nothing...?
You're joking... right?
Maybe I was wrong...
Maybe you're NOT that scary after all.
Only one food pod?
Only one egg pod?
Don't worry BUDDY.
I caught enough for the both of us.
Pathetic...
You're not that impressive after all.
What was I thinking...?
You really caught a lot of food pods.
You really caught a lot of egg pods.
You planning to share?
I mean... we are FRIENDS after all.
You really caught a lot of those...
You know what...? It doesn't matter.
You can't hurt anyone else.
I'LL MAKE SURE OF IT!!!
It doesn't matter how hard you try.
You can't hurt anyone else.
I'LL MAKE SURE OF IT!!!
Oh yeah...
Wash your hair.
You taste terrible.
Go then.
See where hope takes you.
Take the axe? Yes No
Hurt it.
Make it pay.
You're
