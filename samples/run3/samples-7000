======== SAMPLE 1 ========
?
You have terrible planning.
You're like, really bad planning.
Nah.
The floor looks tattered.
Maybe...
There's a jar of pickles in here. Pickles Are Gross.
A little jar of pickle bristle liquid.
A really bad idea.
It's full of something horrible.
It's full of a really bad idea.
With all of the pickles you don't feel like you had a choice.
We wanted to give you something to look for instead.
So now you take the chance of a life of squalor.
You can blame the pickles for your predicament.
You're not ready.
You're not going to hide what's wrong with you.
You got this.
hey look! It's The Newhire. FRESH MEAT
Wait... what?
hurry. Don't Have All Day. LUNCH STARTING
give them what you need. Lunch Ends Here. BOY MEAT
Wait... what?
Give them what you need. I'm on my way.
Yes, ma'am.
So now you give in. You want to hang out?
Yeah... I think I can do this.
So now you give in and let's go?
Well I drink a little can of coffee every now and then. BOY MEAT
Huh... Well... I think I'm done here.
Looks like Fern is using me...!
Yeah... I guess.
Hey, you want to hang out?
You want to hang? I'm hanging because I'm gay.
Hang for a bit? Yes No
Hang for a bit? I'm not gay.
You want to hang? You want to hang! I'm the Guy In The Pool.
WHAT?!
YOU'RE THING!
I don't know what I'm capable of anymore...
Well, that's never too far away...
Well, yeah.
About the right size for a head.
Hey, you can borrow it if you like.
What about the side dishes?
Only one?
No.
I like the idea.
It's not even a kitchenette.
It isn't even a kitchenette.
I feel bad about it.
It isn't even a kitchenette.
I'm sorry...
You didn't have to be this way.
What did you have to do...?
Don't worry about it.
Oh yeah...
Eughta go see him then.
Alright...
You both can meet him there.
Hey, you ready to go?
Sure... just take that thing off your face.
No. I need that humidifier playing over me.
It's empty.
What...?
You lost a chemical snake.
My god, that's sperm.
You're the worst.
There's like a second unit below you.
The snake escapes from under you.
There's a small creature in here.
I see you found a snakey sock. Happy eating.
There's a tongue running through the green?
That's yours.
Nope!
Great't remember to back up if you drink too much?
Fine I'll check the clock.
It's closed but... not yet.
Something goes wrong while working...
The gears block the door and the cactus embryo escapes into space.
Mylar...
It's talked to about as friendlier than a snake.
Not much of a leap for a tiny creature.
The cactus embryo is thriving in its enclosure.
Great now for cacti...
They're elusive after all.
Look to the future for them.
Nothing out of the ordinary.
Ecospore: I see...
Ecospore: Well, that's about the best I can do fer now.
Hey, thanks.
You again, nerf me again.
Hey, nerf me again again.
Disgusting.
You're not paying...
I... I fug...
Dang, dang, dang...
You're not paying...
I can't fix this...
Oh fine... let's get going then.
Alright, what's the catch?
How do I keep from betraying my people.
How do I keep from betraying myself.
Whoa, y'know that pretty face.
You were right...
Yeah and I'm still not a bad guy.
What...?
You're not a bad guy.
What...?
You murdered my parents.
I felt it.
She was right...
I was wrong...
We all did in fact murder them.
So now you know why.
Why even tell me?
Why did you kill my parents anyway?
I don't know...
Well now you know.
Hey look...
All of this is...
