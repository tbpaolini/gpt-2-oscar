What if I was you?
Then... I would have been gone.
What if you were right?
Then I would have been gone.
What if I was you?
Then would you be?
You're wrong.
What if I was you?
You're not that wrong.
What if I was you?
Then I...
Wait...
What...?
I didn't mean to snap at you.
That's not very nice.
Oh...
You're never going to learn.
I was trying to tell you how to handle this.
What is?
BAUGH! That's right! I'm back!
WHERE IS HE?!
GIVE HIM BACK!
He is not back.
He is not on his way.
All you got was one last drink.
So long...
I guess... I don't really know what I'm doin yet.
What...?
Take a minute for yourself.
Relax a bit.
I don't know...
It's alright to do nothing every now and then.
Just give it a shot?
You're wasting time.
We need to leave.
Give it a shot? Like a cowboy. Don't give in.
You're starting to understand.
They are only here to hurt you.
No, I don't think I'm up for it.
Hrm...
So... what now?
You'll have to figure that out on your own.
Wait... what?
Hope you find what you're looking for.
Just... hold on, a minute.
You want to chill like a freezer...?
This is your fault. You're weak.
You're weak.
You sure...?
I don't think I'm up for it.
Hrm...
Yeah...
Well maybe you're right.
Let's press on you silly mutt.
Hey... You alright?
Huh...? Oh... Sorry...
Don't worry about it.
Uhh... what is that?
Bah... doesn't matter.
You sure?
Yeah... I'm out of here...
Hrm...
HOLY HOT HECKIN' DANG!!! WHAT IS THAT?!
Uhh...
TAKE THIS AND CATCH IT!!!

Alright...
Big Seed...
Into the dark.
Hello.
You made this.
This table is covered in silly little things.
Yikes! The carpet is all over these things.
Hey, you found a sock!
That's kind of nasty, but... sticky.
TODO: This is my favorite part of the game. I love the way you make me feel.
This is how you want it.
Heh... I guess you're right.
No worries.
Turn this thing off.
Huh...?
Huh... This mode is super fast.
My word... You're an Actual Potato.
What kind of job you're doing here?
Look at you, crunchy!
Look at you, crunchy!
Stop me then.
I... I don't know how...
Good.
Alright...
Another one here?
New job for you all.
What kind of mushroom?
A clustering mushroom.
Who?
My... what?
You know... A weirdly shaped lump of cold metal.
Why would anyone use that?
You could say I'm a monster.
What kind of place was this?
Baron's Natural Info. She's the head of the Guardians bodyguard company.
Man, you're like, really bad at passwords.
You could use a little help with that.
Setup. Don't Mess Up.
All done being covered in crap.
Hey, you found a THING!
Well, I guess you're right... I'm just...
You're kind of scaring me... Is everything ok?
Of course.
At least... I hope so...
You're recognizing some kind of pattern?
A ESCALATION ESCALATION ESCALATION ESCALATION ESCALATION ESCALATION ESCALATION ESCALATION ESCALATION ESCALATION ESCALATION ESCALATION
Never more than a few creatures will recognize you.
That's alright.
One day I'll leave this place.
The Earth will remember me for them.
We are one.
There is always the future.
Not today, but somewhere in there.
You can't forget what you've done.
You do... get up today.
