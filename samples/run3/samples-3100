I don't know if this is right...
It's not like... intense at all.
Just... intense.
No...
It's fine...
Its all right.
Emelio wait...
This is...
its devising moment.
Weeks of planning passed before I managed to get one.
It lacks ambition and is clearly on the path to perfection.
It's debut is close...
They all doubt my son.
My next move will be most certain.
I will be the first to say it.
You are correct...
The last one is certain to be right.
It may be strong, but it will not stand any chance.
It may be right...
It may be different...
I will be the one to say it.
You are correct...
It excels at short lived arguments.
This creature may be small...
It may be larger...
It may be right...
It arises from nowhere to disagree.
We need to forge an open mind.
One who shares our differences.
We can get back on track.
I believe in you.
You can do it.
Yeah well, I'm not going to rush out.
Keep going...
You didn't do anything.
I... did.

Full of...?
Nah...

Him and I have great-natured ribbing.
Heh... I guess you're right.
You're kind of a maroon after all.
Well... don't worry about it.
Halitos like this don't have as bad of an attachment.
We all did...
We all know what happened next.
It's hard to look away from...
You're probably looking at your best ever.
Some things never change...
We're doing this!
I'm almost there!
The lights are out... and the wind is right next to you!
Let's GO!!!
WHARRGARBL!!!
Hey...
I gotta run.
What was that...?
Something painful. Something painful.
A malformed graf this time of year.
A small malformed deer in a field on a rainy day.
It's a dirtfield on a moist field.
All of this was lost forever.
It's a covered up old man with a deer in mind.
All of this was lost forever.
He looked pretty beat up.
Well that's no reason to be.
Anyway... What did you need me for exactly?
I'm the manager. Just thinkin'.
Hear me out!
Hold me down!
WAIT I HAVE A CRUSH ON THE DEED?!
Uh... sorry. I just want to say I'm really gotalifted.
That's ok.

It's a handbag. You can borrow it if you like.
Wait... what?
What is?
An old handbag. Handbags usually.
What...?
You can't even take things off.
Well... yeah I'm out of here...

Hey you again.
I again.
This time you are stronger.
This time you are stronger.
This part is under control.
So much work.
It just tells you the truth.
You get the hint.
I...
It's too late now.
You really... aren't you?
Yeah...
It's not always always always right...
Glad to see you out there, dude.
Alright then...
I've got your back.
Your back.
You got my back.
You've got my back.

It's bad enough that someone tried to hurt you earlier.
I'm even stronger.
I'm stronger.
You'll get it.
They did.
They all did.
But you didn't stop Abigail.
You didn't stop Abigail.
You didn't stop her.
You didn't stop her from out there.
She was just waiting for you.
That's it?
That's it.
Good choice.
What does it take?
That's it.
So... What's the catch?
You'll get it.
That's it?
Yeah... that's it.
So what?
You didn't stop her.
No matter how hard she tried.
I mean... she probably tried a bunch too.
How do you feel?
I feel like I'm on her side... besides you.
Wait... really
