 in a minute?
Well you didn't.
What's the point?
You didn't even move.
You appeared anyway.
So what did you have in mind?
Uhh...?
For hanging out?
Oh... man I'm not good at this kind of thing.
WAIT I HAVE AN IDEA!!!
Nice, what is it?
Close your eyes.
Oh come on, do it.
Alright... but I'm keeping an eye on you.
With your eyes closed?
Now open your eyes again.
Heh...
Something wrong?
Not at all...
Just haven't taken a minute to relax in a while.
I like to come out here when I'm stressed out.
Helps to get my spirit up and takes away from the moment.
Heh... I guess you're right. I'll be attending to this issue when I'm back.
Alright... so we're off to get Wash up!
She's usually away on business. Not this...
Not like this...
I mean... we are in love.
Not like this...
You wouldn't want to leave your beloved but it's on your terms.
Say hello to the new love... She's expecting.
Sure thing! Follow your heart.
Newhire is like a ghost. Not much of a pickle.
What could go wrong? Definitely not your fault.
Just kidding.
You'll never learn.
This isn't happening...
You did your best. Guyana is a tough job. Good luck, guy.
Hey! Can you be more careful around? Yeah, that's pretty rad.
Don't you have anything better to do?
Maybe we should go?
What did I just say? Don't make me come out there.
Lore...?
Well I guess that solves that problem...
Looks like Camera Man 59 is helping out.
Hey, you work here?
Yes.
The camera maker is here too. What a neat little 'mander!
Hey, you work here?
Yep. I guess I'm onto something.
Anything, really.
Camera Man 59 helpfully assisted us in making this cafe what it is today. -Quiet, unsent, unsent.
So you're saying that because I'm kinda rough?
Maybe because I'm?
You're right. You're right.
I agree with you.
Yet you're wrong.
I'm right about that.
Yet you're wrong.
It's a long time...
I got ideas.
Happens.
Looks like a lot of people were hurt by that...
Doesn't happen.
Nothing is done...
Cut to...
Someone ran into me...
Someone ran into me...
Someone?
Something kidnapped me.
Someone took my pocketwatch.
It's just a... thing.
Time to clean up this mess...
Time to... wash my hands...
Alright... back outta here.
Wow... You look ridiculous.
You know what...? Fine.
You just have to remember to breathe again a little.
Don't you have anything better to do?
Sure... come back with that and we'll get you home.
You sure?
I-I don't think I can breathe like that.
Well don't worry about it.
He earned it.
You're always fighting back.
You're always doing this...
You didn't have to be this way...
You didn't have to be this way...
I'm glad you turned things around.
It's going to be ok.
You're doing much better.
Keep going.
Everything's going to be ok.
You got this.
I'm not mad at you for how you handled this.
I just know you could have done it better.
NOW YOU GOT IT!!!
Where are you?
Don't worry about it.
Check your pocket for a food pod container.
Wait... what?
QUICKLY!!!
How was this in my pocket?
Sleight of paw!
INFURIATED CLUCKING
Delicious food pods...
They're called eggs...
Delicious egg pods...
Get the next egg pod container!

Yes.
INFLAMED CLUCKING
So many egg pods...
I'm getting pretty tired. How many more do you need?
Yes.
INCENSED CLUCKING
