No, I'm not mad at you for how you handled this.
I just know you could have done it better.
NOW YOU GOT IT!!!
Where are you?
Don't worry about it.
Check your pocket for a food pod container.
Wait... what?
QUICKLY!!!
How was this in my pocket?
Sleight of paw!

You're not looking so good either...
CHICKEN SMUGNESS
Not on my watch!
You caught the food bird?
Yes.
A CELEBRATION, I SAY!
CHICKEN SADNESS
Wow... You're pretty terrible at this.
Like you're any better.
That was kind of rough...
You're telling me.
Not much of a haul but it'll have to do.
Sorry...
Don't worry about it.
Not bad!
Thanks!
I mean... not good either.
Thanks...
You almost made it!
Sorry...
Aww... don't feel bad. You did great!
Thanks!
I don't think I can catch it...
Well don't push yourself too hard.
Murder Joe? Absolutely not. What's wrong with a little murder?
Such shoddy workmanship on this one.
I expected better of you brother.
Time to clean up this mess...
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU WIN YOU LOSE
Oh, hey. I was hoping to run into you.
Is everything alright?
Well yeah, at least I hope so?
Uh...
So... what's on your mind?
I'm not good at this kind of thing.
What kind of thing?
This... kind of thing?
Oh man...
I don't know what to say...
Well, what do you want to say?
Pretty sure you know the answer to that.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Let's go home ya big dork.
Sounds good.
We've been friends for a really long time, yaknow?
Yeah, we have.
I just...
You just... what?
I just don't want to mess that up.
I understand.
Really?
Yeah, don't worry about it.
You sure?
I said don't worry about it.
It's Ramul's pocketwatch...
It feels heavier but it weighs the same.
Something about it feels... wrong.
You know...
Actually... Don't worry about it...
Awww... come on. What is it?
Seriously... Don't worry about it.
You sure?
I said, don't worry about it.
Alright then...
I'll uhh... seeya round. I guess...
EEP!!!
You scared the heck out of me!
Sorry. I didn't mean to.
Don't worry about it. Happens all the time.
You're scared all the time?
Nah. Only when striped monsters sneak up on me.
Nah. Only when green monsters sneak up on me.
I'm not a monster...
How do you know?
Do you even know what a monster looks like?
Of course! I'm actually investigating one right now.
Wait... seriously?
Why do you think I'm out here?
Because you're working on your tan?
Ah yes... A mole getting a tan.
This monster is a regular wise guy apparently.
I'M NOT A MONSTER!!!
Then... what are you?
I'm Lore.
Like... the evil brother of that robot guy?
What?
Don't worry about it. I'm sure someone will get it.
Anyway... what do you want?
Ramul gave me this pocketwatch and I'm trying to get it fixed.
Let's take a look.
The woodwork is trashed on this thing.
The gear mechanism seems to be in perfect condition though.
Looks like the gear mechanism is trashed.
The woodwork is really nice though.
We can definitely work with this.
Great looking piece and in good condition too.
Yeesh...
That bad?
Definitely.
Is there anything you can do?
Ever tried painting a garbage fire before?
No...?
Me either. Let's do it.
So, you can fix
