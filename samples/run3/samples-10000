======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 I think her... power?
What kind of power?
It's all frayed and tattered...
... At least some of them are complete trash.
Is this what it feels like?
Not like I wanted to sink your company. Not like I wanted to spend hundreds of millions on a new job.
You're both garbage.
One... five blows the other.
You've done it...
You're not ready.
I'm ready.
AMOUNT OF DOUBLE GLORIOUS SANDWICHES
Wow, look at how ridiculous that is.
Well, ridiculous.
But also pretty ridiculous.
So pretty ridiculous I mean...
You could say the same about me.
Uhh... real historians stuff.
Yeah real historians stuff.
Yeah real historians... seriously.
Well yeah.
It's kind of a tough one.
How do you know?
You wouldn't want to miss a shot if you had to.
So how far off?
Yeah... maybe a few...
Wait... you're talking about actual people?
Yep.
So how do you know?
You're not the real historian?
Nope... not really.
But you're not wrong.
Hrm...
So what kind of real historians do you have?
Well... what do you have?
Magic.
And I'm curious.
Is that all you got?
Been here all my life and then some. Never seen an actual historian.
Who?
Why?
Why did you even think of that?
I... I don't know?
It's my fault.
I don't think I was ready for the part.
What...?
What did you do...?
You shot me first.
Why...?
I don't know.
Why would I shoot you?
Don't worry about it. I got your back.
Thanks, Joe.
No problem.
We're in the way here.
Take the pocketwatch?
Yeah, leave the watch here.
This is dangerous work. Get outta here, wet thing.
Pry about it? Yeah, that's my name for you.
What do you mean? Fine.
What should Rhode do? Follow your heart. Better just play it safe.
She's going to get hurt.
It's your fault.
That's it.
Push her away.
Have you tried telling him?
No...
Maybe you should start there.
What if she doesn't like me back?
What if she does?
What if she doesn't feel the same?
I... I don't know?
That would probably ruin everything...
That's definitely a tough one.
Yeah...
Well, we should probably get going.
Well... we should probably get going.
Ahh yeah, time to stop lazing around.
You think Fern is done with the watch by now?
I wouldn't put it past her.
She's pretty good with her hooves after all.
Anyway... Meet you back at the house.
Sure thing.
Oh, and Lore?
What's up?
Thanks.
Yeah, no problem.
It's been busy.
You again...
This one knows us, dear brother.
It may not wish to, dear sister.
Well, you're right about that.
How unfortunate for it.
We shall see.
In time.
I don't need your pity.
Hello again, little one.
You again...
It recognizes us, dear sister.
It matters not, dear brother.
You don't get to decide what matters.
It has passion.
Without conviction.
We shall see.
In time.
I don't need your judgement.
It has fire.
Yet no spark.
It will not survive.
There are other trials.
There are other cycles, dear sister.
You are correct, dear brother.
Burning with passion.
Yet without control.
It may yet hone the blade.
We shall see.
We shall.
An overwhelming desire to succeed.
It showed a mastery of form and function.
An adept student of the hunt.
Will it continue?
We shall see.
We shall.
That's enough.
Another powerful response.
Backed up with compassion.
It wished to spend time with her.
A proper choice.
It may have chosen for its own gain.
I disagree, dear sister.
Your disagreement is noted, dear brother.
Another powerful response.
Yet lacking compassion.
It chose to abandon this one.
Yet not the other.
It may have chosen out of malice.
We agree.
We do.
Another powerful response.
And full of malice.
It does not care for others.
It wishes to hurt
