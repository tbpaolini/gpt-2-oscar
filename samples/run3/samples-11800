======== SAMPLE 1 ========
'm not going to let you do this.
Get down on your hands and knees.
Absolute mercy.
A mercy that rendered these people useless.
An ordinary breakfast on your terrible judgement.
Will this aid you? No Yes
Dude, can you stop doing this?
I love you.
What?
Don't worry about it. Now let's get going.
You're done.
Sandwiches and drinks all over the floor. That's private...
I don't think I'm done yet.
The red book is still open.
It's not talking or running.
Another sandwich? I mean... it's still open.
I guess you're right... I just think you're kinda blind.
You're kind of blind.
Correct.
You're kinda blind.
Yeah... Yeah... You're kind of blind.
How do you feel?
I feel bad about it.
You know what...? Fine.
I guess you're right.
So now with you de-spookified... What's the plan, dude?
I told you it would be simple enough.
So now it is.
You can't change what happened.
You think I was trying to hurt him? I guess I was?
He's my hero.
He tries his best.
He gives every detail.
All of them have come to nothing.
Heh... You're right.
I'm glad you reconsidered.
Didn't really have a choice.
None of us do here.
Sorry...
Here's Joe's coffee. Bring him the change as well.
Alright, thanks.
You might want to deliver that before it gets cold.
Wait... coffee can get cold?
I see you met Shortstack. Charming isn't he?
Is that really his name?
Sure... you could say that.
Lost and found? I leave lost stuff at the end of the bar.
Thanks, Whistler.
My pleasure.
That's about all I know.
Thanks for all the help.
Thank you for helping Joe. He's a good guy. Cares a lot about this place.
You have an urge to stack these already stacked cups. It's time to get some help.
The jams are too strong to turn off. The jellies are pretty tough too.
It's a menu but there's a lot of options. Better just read one of them.
Egg Salad Mostly fresh!
A Hot Cup of Joe Not the regular kind!
Cup Noodle Pizza Now with more bones!
Mystery Waffle Finely grilled to perfection!
A Peeled Hotdog That's pretty nasty, but ok!
A Picture of Home It's like you're really there!
Freshly Baked Bread Packed into a can!
A Piece of Toast That's it!
A Baby Potato It's still crying!
A Dill Pickle It's kind of a big dill!
Not doing that again.
Welcome to The Watercooler. Chairs have been removed to improve productivity. -The Management
Hey, you're in my personal space.
Stay out of my personal space.
Keep away from my personal space.
Personal space.
Dude, seriously. PERSONAL SPACE.
Thank you for respecting my personal space.
Hey, stay away from my coffees.
How come The Management lets you drink two coffees?
Because I'm freakin' awesome.
This guy is way too awesome to talk to.
Tower Corp is out to get me but I feel alright.
I get up and have a cup of coffee.
On my way to work I have a cup of coffee.
When I get to work I have a cup of coffee.
I live here.
He seems pretty well adjusted.
That's not enough cash for a coffee.
Oh...
Don't look so down. You could always try the vending machine.
Thanks, Whistler.
A beautiful handbag... The strap breaks when you lift it.
A deliciously painful memory is tied to that object.
Where are you...?
Wherever I like.
Well... nobody said you could talk.
Stop me then.
I... I don't know how...
Good. Embrace that helpless feeling.
Now pick up the object.
Alright...
Hold it tightly and close your eyes.
What... was that...?
Something painful. Something hidden. Gnawing its way forward.
I just gave it a little... push.
Find more like this. I want you to feel the rest.
Not enough... I need more...
Definitely the best seat in the house.
An exquisite shelf stands before you.
They just keep piling up. Wish she would quit already.
Better feed Baron before we go anywhere.
