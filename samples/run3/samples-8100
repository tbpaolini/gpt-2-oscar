 Sounds.
The power is too great to turn off.
A hauntingly beautiful book fragment. Strangely, it never moves.
Unable to turn the power on.
This fragment of a blade is surprisingly strong.
Wildly attractive and well-balanced. Not something I would choose against anything.
The fragment shifts as you try to open it.
A small blue book is in the groove. You try to push it but it won't budge.
The forest surrounding this place is so nice this time of year.
It's a stuffing hunt for a newspaper.
It's a terrifying book but is it a stuffing hunt or a jokester?.
A joke in truth.
One day, you're going to get a newspaper.
Maybe a newspaper?.
You're wasting time.
She doesn't deserve this.
You'll never learn.
We're just a few scraps of hopeless jiggly scrawled across the table.
Hey... that's pretty messed up Lore!
You know what...? Fine.
I'm ready.
It's just a stick.
Time to clean up the mess.
You're doing much more than just tinkering around with tiny ideas.
You're doing a lot more tinkering with tiny ideas.
You're doing a lot more tinkering with tiny ideas.
You know what? Fine than.
I'm ready.
No reason to think this one is my itty ba.
I'm not sure if that's terrifying... or what.
Well, thanks.
Leave us alone, Whistler.
Hmpf... Fine...
I'm sure everyone has at some point.
So... how are you?
I'm doing pretty ok, I guess...
I mean... I think I can be a little too hard on myself sometimes.
I'm sorry, I... I'm sorry. Lake Mead.
Wow... You look ridiculous.
You know... like you're not bad.
I guess you're right. I just think you kind of... didn't feel good about things.
You really think so?
I guess?... We did?... We hit it off... we hit it off for a bit and we're going to get out of here together.
Yeah... we're going to get out of here together. You're right. I'm glad to hear that.
Thanks.
I mean... not quite as good.
You're still pretty good though.
Not quite as good as you used to be... but still pretty good.
Yeah, that's good.
Here we go, Newhire. All smiles.
Hey!
What's this thing called?
Not my usual assortment though...
Oh hey! You probably got those too.

This is called... No no.
This is... really bad.
Sound familiar?.

GARBAGE
It's full of addictive snacks.
You may take one with you when you go to work.
This bowl is filled with viciously slurred words.
Are you ready for what comes next?
Sleight of mind.
Not much longer will this sleepy thing be.
Not much longer will it be around to see us.
We can get back on track together. I believe in you.
Hello. You were too weak.
It's winter and you can't be home.
It's going to be ok.
You can make it back home with a little planning.
We've all heard the rumors.
The rumors are getting worse.
We all just want to go home, right?
Well... we do anyway.
What are you talking about?
Back before he told you about to open up.
You can't bring yourself to leave this door open.
Is this what you want? Seeya, fer yourself.
Hey look, it's not perfect. You just has to do what you think is best.
That's pretty rad fur.
Everything is looking good.
We'll see you on the other side, Newhire.
Sounds good, Intern.

We've got to get back to work soon, Intern.
Well, we've got to get back to work soon, Intern.
Wh... what are we doing here?
Pleasure to see you again, Intern.
Nice! Here I find a favor.
This is Horizontal Gently Gross.
You're getting the deathly hell out of here.
That's not quite right...
You're getting the hell here.
Surprise! This is actualry funny.
