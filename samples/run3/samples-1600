It lays before you. It's shrouded in mystery.
What kind?
Personal stuff for you to decide.
I'll see you on the documents...

Speaking and reading Erenian.
Both can be risky endeavors.
Always watch for new paths.
Always remember to breathe long ago.

Inability to control actions.
Will there be others?
These things are super simple.
You'll see.
There's a jar of them under your bed.
Put the jar under your bed.
I UNDERSTAND YOU CAN DO THIS.
A plan is a guide.
Will this fail?
NEVER ELSE!
NOPE!
FADE outALENTS!!!
You found a small key.
Hold down the key and open the door.
It's a simple tangle of leaves and pollots.
A tiny incantation is tucked into the knob.
An old hand-held gaming console.
The only console in here.
It's humungous and lifeless.
The inky sea gave it a strange looking smell.
Wash your towel and lie down at the bar.
Hey Doc?
Yes?
Sure thing. Let's go have a coffee.
ï¿½) Never Had This At This Time
We need this to survive
We're getting stronger
We're not going to put up with this
Fine... I understand...
Why do you hate each other...
Why not each other?
Because you're nothing but trash.
Well that's me. Let's go.
Oh fine... I'm bad at this kind of thing.
 deglaze...
for good or for evil...
I understand...
for whatever it is you're trying to shoulder.
What...?
For anyone.
For the people of light
For all of creation.
All things are signs of the times.
Hey, it's Lore.
Hey, it's Not
Are we...lingsy?
It's pretty much everyone except for us...
Barf of bright red ink.
Hurt...
If You Will Let Me.

You Can't Stop.
This Is Cinder's Fault.
It's a Houdini Top.
The bed is the looks out.
A baby hatter's bed.
A little girl is made of hundreds of tiny parts.
These parts are fantastic.
A bunch of assorted parts.

Designated Treasure Trove, these people make a great kiddie puddle bed.
My husband and I make these. He gets a jolly ride doggone.
We Make A Wish every time he sees us.
We Make A Wish every time he doesn't.
Who made you this way...?
What do you mean?
My parents are... red states...?
The parents of... brothers?
You know, they're the best.
They're still standing pat.
Neat.
Why are you here?
Why did you leave our beautiful young home with those...?
 It's our home.
It's our home.
We will protect it with every ounce of our that we have.
We will make you our husband and wife.
This is not love.
You're joking.
This is a fake.
A small child dying on the couch.
LORE...
All of this and he's getting stronger.
None of this was my design thinking.
Well being a little guy I guess.
So now he's small and strong.
I guess... He likes that.
He's doing pretty well so far.
What kind of business is this?
A little business...
For now.
When I'm older I'll just call this hobby.
You'll know why when I set foot on your farm.
I'm sure - I'm just that good.

You're the best.

They are on my farm.
They are on my farm.
You can't see the mark.
Irsus}
You can't be here...
I've escaped this farm before.
It's called a "prison"... let's call it that.
Incredibly tough and resilient.
Pathetic.
You'll never learn.
Youirgh...
The chain reaction you've created here isn't supposed to work.
We need this to save G8rm's... identities.
Whata aside!
