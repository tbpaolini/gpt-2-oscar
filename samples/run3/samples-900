 need to find a way to get through this.
Wait... what?
What did you... give to Zex?
He's dead.
So... what is he anyway?
A note reading "Join The Guardians"
Hey everyone! I've got a bunch of cool rewards for your help!
Don't worry about them. I'm taking care of them.
That's all I've got!
All of these notes are in my safe at the end of the dungeon.
Why would I need any of this?
You can always go check them out again later.
Might as Well Get The Mail Before Anyone Caps It!
It's still not in season yet! I havent sent it in yet!
Drink the morning elixir? I've got nothing to hide!
Oh come on, drink the drink.
What about aftershave time for now?
You might want to drink it immediately after you shave.
Oh... Sorry.
No changes to make.

You take a few deep breaths.
You're weak.
Look at how worthless he is are you going to buy time?
Hey... uh... aren't you almost have or something?
It's lunch break now and you can't rush home.
I know you're struggling.
You're ready.
You might want to be prepared.
Not everything will be possible.
I believe in you.
You got this.
Everyone makes mistakes sometimes.
Don't worry about it. You did ours.
Thank you for showing me how to get over this.
Yeah well, I didn't think that came as a big of a shock.
Things could have at the end ofâ€¦ again.
This wasn't how I wanted to go down.
It's okay.
You did your best.
You just can't do all of this alone.
You really just have to do this alone.
You need to get going.
You can go find someone else and everything.
You alright?
Yeah well...
I... what...?
You sure about that.
Give me this.
Yeah well...
I didn't really want to go after that at all.
Hey... are you alright?
Yeah sorry... I just think about them too much.
Doesn't matter how bad they are.
You know...
Yeah sorry.
Don't worry about it.
She isn't here.
Huh...
Don't worry about it.
What...?
Suffocate in the animal kingdom for joy?
You really can't be here...
You think I could just as easily explode?
Who would want to be here?
Do you really have any chance here?
No...
Well... It wouldn't be my first time.
Just give in.
Just give in...
Well, give in.
Well, give in.
He got what he deserved.
You're getting tired of it.
You think I wouldn't give him what he deserved?
Well... He deserves this.
You think I wouldn't give in?
You think I wouldn't give in to your ideals?
Well... You're probably right...
You're probably wrong...
You probably are.
There's always the visitor.
There's always the counter.
Finally...
Found you again.
Did you find what you were looking for?
Iida... You again.
I see... This isn't what I wanted.
It was meant to be here...
To stay and... Not anymore.
Told you...
I am the best you'll ever be.
