?
Is that... salt in a saucepan?
Oh, sorry... let's use that as a model.
Thank you, Emelio.
Now we'll need to cook it.
In the meantime... Cook the fish?
In order to help Baron, I need to know your name.
Alright... I'll get you out of here.

Hey buddy.
I know things can get tough sometimes.
Just don't forget to have fun, even if it all looks grim.
Follow your heart and don't give up on anything or anyone.
I will always be with you, right by your side.
We got this.
Don't worry about today. A little bump in the road is not a big deal.
A sickly world of sand and cactus under a pale green sky. The wind howls against the glass.
A hauntingly beautiful forest in the dead of night. The moon has a chunk taken out of it.
Thanks for playing Heartbound! We hope you liked the game so far! Live Dev Streams piratesoftware.live Join The Community discord.gg/PirateSoftware Get The Merch! gopiratesoftware.com/store
Hey, Stripefriend!
Hey, Greenfriend!
Uh... hey?
Sorry about Emelio... He gets a bit caught up in being a hero.
It's alright. People make mistakes sometimes.
TODO: This needs to reflect what Lore learned in terms of conflict due to Jotunheim.
Yeah... He was a bit rough but thankfully I'm alright.
Anyway, I wanted to give you something for the trouble.
What is this?
It's a pocketwatch. So you can watch the hours go by!
I don't know what the pocket part is for though...
It looks a little beat up.
It's a bit scuffed but that's ok.
It looks like someone smashed it.
Maybe Emelio can fix it? He's pretty good with stuff.
You can usually find him in the cave down south from here.
Just look for the cactus!
Well, thanks.
I gotta run! Got... stuff to do before work.
Alright, seeya round.
A ledger sits on a cool smooth stone.
Record the journey so far? No Yes
The ink sinks into the page and fades out. Your progress has been saved.
At least this place seems comfortable.
Rest in the soft grass? No Yes
This is the final challenge. The next room holds The Artifact.
Alright... I'll try not to get lasered... in space... and stuff.
Quality plan.
We will save them from its power...
We will keep them safe with it...
I see you survived the fall.
Ahh... This form disturbs you?
Guardians change depending on the world they enter. I have no control over it.
Wait... Binder?
Correct.
With that settled. Have you found The Artifact?
Lie to him.
He doesn't need to know.
Tell Binder the truth? I found the book. I've never seen it.
I see... This complicates matters.
A shame... We will have to look... elsewhere.
So... how do we get Baron back?
Make your way through The Tower. Find a fragment of his essence.
What do you mean a fragment? What does it look like?
A point of light that shifts gently while observed.
This doesn't make any sense...
How is that even possible...?
I will explain when it's over.
When it's over?
What does that even mean?!
It must be hard in your... situation.
I hope you will see the truth in the end.
Why not just tell me now?
My explanation will have to wait for another time.
No. I need to know what's going on.
Goodbye for now.
Hey Newhire! Miss me?
Uhh... Yeah, sure.
Good! Are you ready?
Ready for what?
It's time for your TERMINATION!
Wait... what?
You're no longer valuable to Tower Corp. So now you're being deleted. Lucky you!
You can't be serious.
You're right! I'm OScar!
Have a good sixty seconds, Newhire!
Only a few seconds left and you want to spend them with me? I'm honored.
You can't do that... I'm company property...
Here we go, Newhire!
Wait... stop!
There you go, Newhire. All done being terminated. You can go see the boss now!
So... you're not going to
