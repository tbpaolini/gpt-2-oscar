======== SAMPLE 1 ========
.
You're already done?
Destroy the whale? That's pretty cheesy, dude.
You really couldn't stand up to her then.
I mean... I couldn't either. Let's be real.
Digging the whale? That's pretty tough.
I wonder what kind of place this is?
Looks like Newhire Newhire.
Newhire. Gah...
You almost made it!
You did your best...
You were quicker than expected.
I... I'm wrong...
I was right about you.
You're right about me.
I'm right about you.
You made it!
I was stronger than you were.
I won't let you grab me again.
I GOT THIS!!!
Someone finish you.
Something warm.
Sitting down.
You wanting to run?
Not yet.
Hunting is fun.
Time to wake up.
We don't have all day.
Hunting is risky.
You can't guarantee it.
I'm getting ready to go.
Go with your heart.
What did you need?
Everything you needed.
Everything inbetween.
Time to get tough.
You can't bring yourself to do something do nothing.
What was I thinking...?
Well, I'm done here.
Have I done enough?
Yes.
Is this how you wanted things to go down?
Are you hurting anyone by being quiet?
No...
I'm not ready...
You could be a homicide trial...
If you're not ready then I'm not trying hard enough.
HYAAAAA!!!
How long is this going to take?
Remember when I was a kid? I was your friend.
I don't even like food.
I like you, Honey.
I'm sorry...
Hrm... Alright then...
I want to be good like you were before me.
How do you know I'm good?
Do you really want to hear that?
No...
I just know you could be anything you wanted to me.
I'm ready.
Something clicks and the camera is rolled.
Who made you this way...?
I do not know you, or Rhode.
What...?
I did...
You really did...
I don't know anything about Rhode.
But I did want to ask you.
Why did you do this?
I saw a guy like you.
Ibin===============
Huh... Alright then.
I believe you.
So what happened?
Reading that carefully doesn't mean you're alone.
I don't want to spend my life with a bad guy.
You're right. I will always be with you.
I'm sorry, bud.
Good, we can get back to bed.
So... what do you want?
Time to figure things out.
So... how do you want to spend your time?
Choice: Lighthearted
I want to be as kind as I can be.
That's the idealistic spirit you require.
In order to survive as long as you do, you will have to work very, very hard.
So... how do you spend your time?
After all of this...
You really don't have much in the way of stamina.
Looks like 4C is open! Right next to that weird shirt guy. Have fun with the rest of your career!
Time for some IT work! First row on the left. Don't be late!
Go play with your food! Second row on the left. Don't be late!
Try to sneak in? Nope! All done being lazy? Yes No
I see you met Shortstack.
Home? What could explain you?
I wouldn't want to spend my life with you.
Well... I guess you're right.
Let's roll!
Yeah what did you need?
For a little trick in the wild.
Pointy poof... what was that?
Something providential.
Incoming!
Nice! It's full!
This thing is getting heavy...
Nah, I'm good.
Well, I'm good.
I'm not good either.
Uh... what do you want?
Heh... let's roll.
Yeah let's go.
Sorry...
Seeya.
The clock is ready for you.
Ready for what?
You can't hit the fan yet.
So what do you want?
Well... I think this is it.
So what's going on?
You can't run this far...
I mean... I'm just saying that from a technical standpoint.
So how far is this issue alone?
Not much...
Maybe half of it?
The power is still on...
Maybe it's not back yet?
I...
What... really happened here?
What... me?
