You got this.
Anytime.
Look, I know I can't do much but be a good dad to a fine one, so please don't give up.
Any idea what that looks like?
Yeah, maybe a head?
The size of me and you.
You know what, whatever.
You're not looking.
You're not looking.
end of video
I mean... you got this.
Any idea?
Any idea...
Nothing.
I just need to know.
Anytime.
Look, I can do this.
Anytime.
Hey, you alright?
OH! DON'T YOU HEARD THAT MEOWO coming?
OH! DON'T HEARD THAT O.O.
TODAY WE ALL GO ON...
Wake up tomorrow.
Is something wrong?
Maybe I'm too good at this thing to see...
TTag night!
Hey OScar!
Thanks!
I mean... You don't have much of a skill for paperwork.
Oh hey, you made it!
I'm glad you signed up.
It's paperwork for you.
You know what, if you didn'thin' but said something nice things about me.
Oh yeah?
.........................
Wait... Don't worry about it.
That's not what happened.
You just had to deal with it like a good dad.
That's right.
You were right about you.
You didn't.
You wanted to make sure.
It's not real.
Not really my forgings, but that's what life is for.
You know...
Yeah... wrong idea.
Good for you.
You're starting to understand.
You really just wanted to see what your problem was, didn't have any choice.
You didn't have much of a choice.
You chose to follow your heart.
You really just wanted to see what Nahhe would do.
You may have been right about what you wanted to see, but you weren't wrong about what happened.
It's not your fault.
I...
You're wrong.
Hurt them.
Let them fix it.
So that's it?
Not really...
You just had your fun.
Nothing to do in the kitchen.
Hey, you said you wanted to go fishing.
Wait... you actuallyshot the deer?
Nahhe...
You really did just shoot the deer.
You don't have any in common.
Nahhe...
Shelly is.
What's with the confusion?
It's your fault.
You know what? Fine...
What with the...
Inherit the blame?
That's my fault.
You alright?!
Yeah, sorry... Leave it to me.
I shouldn't have done this.
Leave it to me.
Shelly may have been right about you, but she wasn't always my guy.
I...
He was kinda trashed.
And then there was a grainy pic of you holding it up as proof.
You're not supposed to remember that.
One day you'll.
Don't worry about it.
Just get over here, alright?
You just threw a stone.
Nothing.
You really did just throw a stone.
You really threw a stone.
I... I'm sorry...
It's fine... I just can't remember...
That's at the memory sink.
Er... do I have to remember that?
A small gem sits on the table.
Terrifying...
I just...
Stamp each gem with a stamp...
That's it.
Now you know.
I should have paid more attention to what was going on.
It's not that I wanted to teleport, it's just...
Trapped in a apparently natural forest?
You can't be a monster just yet.
There are monsters in here.
