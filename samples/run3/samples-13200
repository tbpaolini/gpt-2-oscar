 of that?
Leave him there.
He deserves this.
You'll always be pathetic.
You could be so much more.
She was right about you.
They all were.
However.
It won't matter.
They're coming.
That's enough.
Show them your strength.
No more hesitation.
It will be over soon.
You need to wake up sometime.
I SAID THAT'S ENOUGH!!!
Your choice.
It's glowing like the sun. Look inside. Take a minute.
Going to try again?
Last cycle worked out so well for it.
It's not real... This isn't happening...
Typical 12345.
Dear brother, handle this one won't you?
It isn't my place to handle this nor is it yours, dear sister.
I expected nothing less.
You know my nature as I know yours.
It's very persistent.
Always pushing forward. Never stopping.
This isn't happening...
Poor sweet, 12345.
Don't give up. Keep going.
It isn't your place to choose, dear brother.
You are regretfully correct, dear sister.
It must forge its own path.
Who... are you?
It doesn't know.
That is the way of things.
A damaged vessel?
Give it time. We shall test it.
I'm not here to play games.
A strong response.
A strong response.
Agreed. Decisive and straight forward.
A proper path even if this one is damaged.
It set about helping him then followed through in his time of need.
We approve.
Yes we do.
Yet lacking conviction.
It doesn't follow through.
It left him there. In the darkness. Alone.
Morality is irrelevant.
Agreed, dear brother. Decisive action is what matters.
Unfortunate, dear sister. It chose to help him then left him anyway.
Without a set path it will falter when the time comes.
We shall see.
We shall.
Yet it can't make a decision when it matters.
It set to help him.
Then left him in the dark.
Then chose to help him instead.
All mixed up.
Lost in choice.
Yet it has no follow through.
It lacks conviction.
It helped him to escape the dark.
Yet it wanted to leave him there.
Decisive action is what matters most, dear sister.
It's not ready, dear brother.
It either will be or won't be. We are here to observe.
Let us wait for it to conclude.
Yet it lacks compassion.
Morality is irrelevant, dear brother.
Agreed, dear sister. Decisive action is what matters.
True to the path, regardless of others.
It wished to inflict harm and took the opportunity to do so.
We approve.
Yes we do.
Yet it's plagued with indecision.
It set out to hurt him.
Then left him in the dark.
At the last moment it helped him anyway.
Such indecision.
Leaving the path it forged.
A pity.
You... don't know what I've done.
You have no idea who I am.
Some things are known, little one.
Not yet enough.
You might be right but I can't say that for sure yet.
Humility will help on the path.
It will also block the way.
Clarity brings action.
Action brings clarity.
Destroying that statue was an action.
Was it out of passion?
Duty?
Rage?
It needs control.
It needs to be unleashed.
Preserving the statue was an action.
Was it out of fear?
Reverence?
It needs to break these bonds.
It needs to keep control.
Perception brings action.
It missed a choice.
Give it time. There will be others.
Why are you telling me this?
Why does this even matter to you?
It's doing well.
It is.
I hope this one makes it, dear brother.
We are the same, dear sister.
It may learn in time.
It may.
Goodbye, little one.
Good luck, little one.
Take your time. Think things over.
The lights are out. It's time to leave.
I don't know if I agree with you...
Take the quick way back? Who needs to see the same thing twice? I do things the hard way.
You've got a glowing stone now but you feel pretty uneasy.
Welp. I've lost it.
Talking animals... Floating heads... What next?
Don't forget about me.
Where are you...?
Wherever
