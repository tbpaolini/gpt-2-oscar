======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 corporate company. He's a criminal.
What...?
Don't worry about it. I'll try 'til the day I'm finished.
Enough?
Leave me alone.
Leave me alone.
Hmpf...
Dragger...
Always... too forceful.
Always indecisive.
Sometimes brutal and revealing.
All around it's a strange pile of gold and platinum...
Crushed coins litter the table.
Blistering sandstorms undergave a faint hint of life.
Aged obliviates this shelf.
Aged obsiously.
Aged obsiously.
It's completely packed with empty pages.
It must be sealed away...
...or is it just a dark secret?
$ElvisNewt: Oof...
The leatherbound handbag is resting on the shelf.
You can't even pick it up!
The only thing you could pick it up were those pesky deer.
Seal the baggie...... and pick up the leathery subject.
I'm not a zombie...
You're a criminal. I can't decide your sincerity but to say it was brutal and necessary.
It's full of scrapped engineering ideas.
These should be the results...
You didn't order this from a shady criminal...
I'm not a zombie...
I'm a criminal nonetheless...
Thanks for the life advice.
Forensics... You're right... maybe I'm a terrible scientist.
My research shows us things get a little messy when you overstep.
I'm not a criminal...
In fact, I'm almost positive... maybe you're right.
Filled with rage and half the coin scientists at the moment.
Polluting prisons, society rife... nobody gives a hoot about things like that.
Unfortunately, this is not a sunny environment.
Too much activity and polluting the air.
Leaving the lab too soon.
Yikes... Greenbarrels make me mad.
What do you mean... taxidermists?
I mean... The laws say trees should be able to do what they do?
I'm sure everyone has an opinion on this, hmm...?
Let's take a look.
The handle is hanging out the side.
Hey... That's not the point of the taxidermist's law. I just expect... None of this...
Looks like the key is in good condition. Lab rat. Lab wasting.
Working in an office can be stressful. Right?
No... You're always stressed out.
Try again later this month. I don't get up anyway.
I'm sorry, nothing.
You're always stressed out.
I'm sorry, lab rat.
Working in an office can be stressful. Right?
No...
Try again later this month. I don't get up anyway.
I'm sorry, lab rat.
You're always stressed out.
I told you I wouldn't make it here.
Well I mean... I was stressed out.
But I'm not mad.
What did you expect?
More time.
Seriously?
You didn't expect this?
I hope you figure it out.
I've thought about it plenty.
It's been years.
You're right.
I'm sorry. I... I don't really know what to think about it.
Well... maybe you should start?
What do you think the results would be?
Weigh it down a bit.
I think we should leave.
I think we should go now.
What did you expect?
A bunch of lab rats alike.
Neither of us are rodents.
Well... we're both and neither is ham.
Harmon may be bigger than him but he's still lab rat.
Half of the lab rats are lab rats.
We're both lab rats.
Yeah he is but he's still lab rat.
All of these lab rat results are in denominations of a dollar.
So the pay was in order?
In every way.
Couldn't be me.
Really?
Oh yeah?
That's pretty sad.
Well maybe you're right...
I guess you're right.
Sorry...
Don't worry about it.
I guess you're right.
Good.
Alright then...
I'll try not to get in your way.
I've got my lunchbox.
It's heavy to the bone.
Also... I don't want to dig through it.
Also... I don't want to dig through the...
That's fine...
I'm with you on that.
So how far away is this place anyway?
Hmmm... maybe a little?
What if I'm alone?
Then it doesn't matter.
Then it's not my place to direct it.
Hrm...
Well that's fair.
Looks like the
