======== SAMPLE 1 ========
't go looking for the owl...
It's actually a friend.
What are you waiting for?.
You weren't there for him.
Now he's gone.
You thought you could just read my thoughts?.
Search through my memories like this?.
STRINGS will only get you so far.
Don't give up. Not now. Not yet.
You can do this. Just a little farther.
This wasn't what I wanted. Not like this.
Everything is going to be ok. Just keep moving.
You can't run this time.
He's not coming back.
You failed him.
It's your fault.
You did this.
You found a shadowy sock. Sneaky!
He looks pretty beat up.
Nothin' a little pick me up can't fix.
Do you really think you can help him?
O'course kiddo, I can do anything.
I'm not a kid anymore, Cirsi. I grew a bunch over the summer and everything!
Ear length don't count for nothin. Kiddo.
Now help me get him back to town.
Dad...?
What are you doing here?
I should have listened to you.
I should have paid more attention to what was going on.
I just got so wrapped up in work that I forgot what it meant to be a dad.
I let you down.
You're right. You did.
I'm sorry...
Hey, dad?
Yes?
Nevermind...
The door won't open for hardened criminals like you.
It's locked and nobody seems to be answering.
Off to find my own adventures. -A Wild Cryptozoologist
Off to care about something else. -A Former Cryptozoologist
No sense sticking around. -An Awkward Cryptozoologist
Getting ready for the next hunt. -A Cryptozoologist
WORKS DONE!!!
She may be small but she can sure yell loud enough...
I HEARD THAT!!!
Wh... what's going on...?
Wait... She's gone...
Just like the others...
OH NO!!!
Bluhhhh...
OH MAN... This is bad...
Flurrrghhh...
OH CHEESE... He hit the ground super hard...
Nyuhhhhh...
OH GOSH... He's totally gonna die...
Clearly there's only one solution...
TIME TO BLOW THIS GUACAMOLE STAND!!!
It's full of... socks?
You can't even wash them. There isn't any soap.
Can't... turn... away...
This toaster looks like a champion.
About the right size for a head.
Turn on the stove? Yes No
Great now it's a fire hazard.
Everything in here has gone bad.
Collect the trash? Yes No
Garbage mountain once stood here.
Obtained a can of Viking Feast brand dog food.
Nice! That's my favorite one!
Nothing to put in the bowl.
Feed Baron the Viking Feast? Yes No
Feed Baron some of the Garbage? No! Yes, I am a terrible person.
Feed Baron? Viking Feast Garbage
The glorious Viking Feast pours from the can into Baron's bowl. It has little axe shaped meats in it.
I always wanted to be a viking. They're so cool.
Heh, I'm sure. Hurry up so we can get going.
I'm already done!
What?! How did you finish so fast?
WITH VIKING POWER!!! Let's go finish our adventure!
He made really quick work of that.
The garbage slumps into Baron's bowl with a disappointing wet sound.
Hey... That's pretty messed up Lore...
I didn't expect this from you...
The sickening mush glistens in the bowl.
Hey! Where are you going? Don't leave yet...
Don't do this to me... Come back with that!
The can is over on the counter. I would open it myself but... paws and stuff.
I'm ready! What's the flavor of the day?
OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH MAN OH
Still need to grab the garbage.
It won't turn on...
Well at least it isn't a fire hazard now.
He's not here...
What was I thinking...?
Looks like the power is still on. That's good at least.
Things are looking up for our brave adventurers.
Heh, I guess you're right. Let's press on you silly mutt.
Mutt?! How rude!
That lightswitch frying must have killed the power...
