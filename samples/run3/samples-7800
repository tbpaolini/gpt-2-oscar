 hard on your part...
That's my... Yeah...
Yeah... You do realize how hard it can be.
Just... don't give up.
I HAVE WON!!!
You can do this.
You can do that...
Hurt them.
Definitely.
Except... She doesn't exist.
You can't be serious.
This is what I wanted.
Why do you need someone else to tell you who to love?
Why is that my passion?

FLORIDA RIGHTS
FLORIDA GLOBAL HEAT
It's too stormy to see anything...
Maybe you're right...
I warned you.
It's too stormy to see anything...
Maybe you're wrong...
I didn't say that time.
It's too hot out...
No need to get dressed.
It's too busy running to check on you.
It's too busy running to look around for you.
It's too busy running to look for you.
It's too busy running to do nothing.
It's too running to do nothing.
It's running to look for.
It's personal.
It's private.
I could have said something more...
Nice work.
Ew...
I wasn't able to catch the last flower.
I.....
Must have died during the night.
Might as well deliver this one sooner.
Ohh...
Sorry...
Don't worry about it.
Ohh...
I didn't die during the night.
IAAAAAAAAAAATE THE THING!!!
Wait... What...?
You were still capable of being a brother to time control...
It's not like I could stop it...
It is a fact of nature.
Life doesn't always consist of tiny pieces...
I see...
There's still time to change.
Things don't have to be this way.
Do you want things to be this way? I can fix this. This is how it should be.
Do you want things to be this way? Yes  No 
I don't blame you for what you've done.
However, there is no going back.
You can't undo the past.
Don't worry though, Timeio.
You will do better.
I SAID THAT'S ENOUGH!!!
So... how do we get you back to life?
As long as you have the strength.
Just... let me catch you.
So... how do we get you back to life?
As long as you have the will.
Just... stop wasting my time.
Just... stop wasting your time.
I SAID THAT'S ENOUGH!!!
Thank you, Emelio.
No problem.
I don't really know how you manage willpower.
Just... stop wasting it.
Just give it a shot.
What are you waiting for?.
GO AWAY!!!
THE SKILLS HAUNT IT!!!
It's too complicated tome...
You can get it with Emelio.
What...?
first row on the left.
First row on the right.
Then the others.
wait... row 3.
Next row on the left.
Right after that.
wait... row 3.
JUST STOP!!!
ALWAYS ONCE CLOSE!!!
I can't be good...
Just like you...
They seem... distant...
Nothing like what I see here.
The world looks more like I remember...
I'm right about one thing: find you brother.
He's too busy jogging to hear you.
He's too busy looking for you.
He's too busy doing his job to hear you.
Yes...
No Yes, ma'am.
Good joke.
All jokes are made possible in large part by you.
A little caveat: my name is Lore.
Don't worry about it. I'm good like that.
At this time of year we don't have a natural light.
Last chance.
Make them pay.
Hurt them.
Make them pay? Yes  Yes 
That's my job.
The hard work is done.
Working hundreds of dollars on little projects.
Getting the gear chain pinned.
All this fixing just feels wrong.
It's all just a job.
You can do it anything.
It's called work.
Everyone works for a living.
You should be able to do your job.
Do you need help? No Yes
Then I would be very thankful for what little was there for.
The hard work paid for itself.
You're working on your late husband's head. It looks like it's gone bad.
He may be a big nerd, but he's also pretty good with computers.
Software is pretty tough at 4
