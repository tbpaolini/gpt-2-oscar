======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 who is not here.
This should take away from the events at the end of it.
The lights on the bookshelf are all out.
It's Paul Riemann's old red book. It's just smashed open.
What... you're here?
I mean... no... This isn't right... It should've been marked off.
Looks like the power is still on. That should help.
Things are looking up Spacey.
He's a good boy. He's doing better.
Draco's a terrible boy. He's learning and just doing his best.
Oh wow, look at the sock! He looks fantastic!
Yeah, that was definitely sock metal.
Sealed properly from years of use.
One so far wrapped around the other that it can't be seen.
A cute little sock. Ambitious person.
Well, you're doing fantastic things. You should be thanking them.
I'm glad you see the things...
Things that shouldn't be.
This is where I see them.
Everything.
The same old tired socks.
Dense and unmoving.
It's lost its glow.
Looks like the power is still on. That would probably ruin a good idea.
It's really crude.
Open the book and you won't find a single word about work.
That's kind of grim!
Anyway, that's contractwork for sure.
There's a lot that's not hard... careers in and of themselves.
You don't have any money.
Well, that's still quite a fee to pay for a skill.
Plus, it's just a job.
Nice, don't undercut me.
UPHWHERE?! How are you?
I'm still on the move! I-I should have listened to you.
What... point of view?
Where are you?
Take the bridge.
taboola is out of pocket
I... walked away?
INFURIATED
Take the helm? No Yes
FULL SHUT UP
DOUBT! I CAN DO THIS!
I'm fine.
I know you're supposed to be the center of attention.
Nobody can stop you.
Why should it matter when another can?
Why do you have to keep moving?
It's not enough to stand in their way.
They're ahead!
Hey, you want to know more?
I...
Are you ready?
Congratulations Alpha Centauri Home, you've made this far.
We're done here. Leave this alone.
Alright, something else for you.
What did you need?
Something to eat?
Something to eat?
I hit seven and everything is fine.
Alright, you've made it!
I mean... You're definitely not the best at self pity.
Oh...
You're kind of scaring me... isn't this bar already full up?
I mean... You're not the best at self pity.
So, have you made the right choice?
Well, I think.
Well, I'm pretty terrible at it.
What...?
It's my fault.
She's gone because of you.
Ahh... just give me a minute.
Are you ready? You've already killed enough people that I need your help.
Alright...
It's too late now. You'll be seven years old when I'm old.
You know... I'm pretty terrible at it.
Ahh... just give me a minute.
Have you tried telling me why?
When you were a child you on...
When you were a small child youh...
Make that seven...
I don't know what you made...
I'm not good enough...
Make way for the next generation.

Your progress has been must and you continue the quest.
At the end of the level you'll receive a small key.
Rewards? A heart filled with hate? A small panda fur.
A vicious snake.
Sick of them.
They came to take me.
They're nothing but garbage.
They wanted to take you.
When you came to take them.
You were too weak.
My best friend.
I'm sorry Baron...
Don't give up.
We can fix this.
In the end, it's about.
Why?
You don't know.
You didn't exist any longer.
I'm sorry...
It's your fault.
It's your to fix...
You're weak.
You'll always be weak.
What can we do?
We can do this
