As he was getting ready to go inside, he took in a deep breath before opening his eyes to see her leaning against the wall. It was a beautiful red headstone surrounded by lovely golden rocks.

He turned to look around but she immediately closed her eyes. He could do better.

He quickly closed his eyes again and went to sit up on her.

She looked so pretty he could barely place her against his chest. He didn't want her to think he was just a weirdo.

He walked back to the rock and stood up.

He was right beside her.

She leaned back in her chair and saw him with a very familiar expression.

He didn't move.

She was sure to be disappointed.

She didn't want to do anything.

He didn't say anything.

She didn't let that stop her. He didn't get any of it together.

She finally saw his face and gave him a quick look.

Her name was Sara.

She was the only one there and she knew it.

He didn't say anything.

She wasn't happy.

She gave him a quick look and thought quickly.

It's not her fault.

No way! He didn't mean anything. You know what? Nah. Sure.

Alright, here let's go.

You're welcome.

He said nothing.

She didn't need to say anything to get you going.

He felt sorry for her.

He doesn't need to.

She just didn't want to talk to him.

Why is that?

Nah...

Haha...

Alright...

Now where is she?

He doesn't need to...

Can you help?

We need to find her.

We gotta reach this place.

We can't stop her...

What do you mean...?

I mean, I've always wanted to go there... but you can't leave.

Why do you need to go there?

Because she's hurting me...

Because I thought it would.

Because you know right?

Well now you're right again...

Why did you take that chance...?

Because she's hurting you.

Because she's hurting you as well huh...?

She's hurting you like her family...

You know what?

That's it.

It'll happen.

You've got to help her.

She's hurting you.

She's hurting you!

Why does she have to suffer?

Because you always feel bad for her.

The only thing she can do is give in now?

Well yes so long as you take her back.

She didn't have to fight for you.

The only person she can help is you.

She's hurting you.

The only thing she can do is stop you now?

Yes.

It's almost over.

Let's get rid of this bad girl now.

This is all going to be alright for now huh?

No problem huh. Go ahead and get some rest.

It's over.

It's over.

It's over.

It's over.

It's over.

It's over.

It's over.

It's over.

It's over.

That was a pretty good fight.

You guys are going to go out there to see her.

She needs to leave now.

It's too late to have any fun.

You're not going to have any fun after all of this.

This place is too bad.

We gotta leave.

You can't leave.

Alright, go.

You're not alone.

You're not alone.

What are you doing?

Just looking for someone to blame.

Don't worry.

The things just aren't quite right.

The things are definitely wrong.

I think I'm going to have to get out of here.

Wait... what?

Wait... what?

You gotta do something.

Go do something.

It's done.

You're done looking for her.

What?

Just leave her alone.

It's too late for anything.

I've probably done something like that before.

Why not give me some time?

Well let's go meet her when she's in town.

Don't go chasing after her.

Hurt her.

Stop her.

I'm sorry you couldn't
