======== SAMPLE 1 ========
Oh, don't do this to me... Not now, not yet. I need this. I need your help.
OH!!!
Watch what I do!
Wait... watch what I do?
You're right! I'm OScar!
NOT!
NOT!!!
No...
I want to be good!
What?
You're right... Why do you ask?
For advice?
For what?
I'm glad to hear that.
Oh... sorry...
Don't worry about it. You ready to go?
Have fun with Rhode!
That's it... get going.
I'm already done!
LEAVE GUSTO!!!
Hey, you made it!
Yeah, pretty much.
First row on the left. Don't be late!
Second row on the left. Don't be late!
First row on the right. Don't be late!
Have fun with the rest of your career!
Second row on the left. Don't be late!
Have fun with the rest of your career!
This whole thing just feels weird.
The boss is still nearby...
Don't pass.
She's gone...
You found... A new one... A little bag of trash.
A few flower seeds... Some really pretty.
A bunch of ants... For the best part of two weeks.
NEET I HAVE TOTALLY HURT YOU!!!
Wow... You're unyielding.
Also... Go get a cold.
Also... I'm fine.
Wait... you're dead.
It's been covered in flour.
It's... really bad...
Nothin' I could say nice.
The stone giant lie is still in 'ambition'.
They tell tales...
The wise speak of it.
Bahrain...
Well... I think we should head back.
We should get out of here. I got stuff to do!
Everything ok?
Yeah... Don't worry about it.
Ack... what's wrong?
Am I not being a good enough friend?
Be the hero of my own story.
What...?
JUST STOP!!!
Nah.
You were just like him.
I'm glad I could help him.
He's more than capable of being that... cool.
I'm sorry Baron...
You're not being helpful.
I really couldn't do it like that.
What are you talking about?
Talking... talking?
Pirate...
You've cursed me with your own twisted and abominable abomination.
I will not bow before you.
No... I'm not willing.
Hurt...
You hurt her.
It's its blade.
Don't worry about it.
Aren't you supposed to be focusing on the job?
Huh... that's easy!
Well... let's get going then.
Lost and found?
Well, I'm just fine.
First row on the right. Don't be late!
Second row on the right. Don't be late!
Don't forget to sleep.
Alright... I pass.
Great. I'll be right back!
So... how are you?
I'm doing pretty ok, I guess...
Well, I mean... I think I can be a little too hard on myself sometimes.
Awkward...
Newhire has finally quit.
You... are you... any better?
Eternally losers.
You... are you... any better?
I guess... I'll see you on the other side, Newhire.
So, you quit.
I, I don't know what I was thinking...
Maybe I was hoping to counter-aggravate you...
It just wasn't enough...
I wasn't enough...
I almost had you...
That's not what happened.
Just... just don't do it again.
That's what works the first time.
Don't worry about it.
I'm not even sure if it was worth it or not.
How did you know?
You wouldn't know.
You told me.
I.
Or what?
OR...
Or what?
Oh... Sorry...
Don't worry about it.
Alright... Ramul told me.
Yeah...
So... what did you have in mind?
Uhh...?
For hanging out?
Oh... man I'm not good at this kind of thing.
WAIT I HAVE AN IDEA!!!
Nice, what is it?
Close your eyes.
Oh come on, do it.
Alright... but, I'm keeping an eye on you.
With your eyes closed?
Now open your eyes again.
He made me do this.
You... did?
You were nothing but goody Joe.
I don't know if I was damaged or not...
