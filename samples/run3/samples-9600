======== SAMPLE 1 ========

Well you should... I need to head back.
Am I not being a terrible person?
Go with Fern? No Yes
Go? No Yes
You made the right choice...
You can't change what happened.
You don't have the compassion to know what happened...
It's alright if you don't want to follow directions.
But the more you follow, the farther away you are.
I hope you learn the same lesson, man.
You do deserve the compassion.
I've got a question for you.
What is this?
Is this food for thought?
I'll tell you when you're older.
Is this... am I right or am I not right?
You can't be serious sometimes.
You got this.
 thing is alright
I hate myself for it...
You can be whatever you want to be.
I don't hate you, dude.
I just don't see why you should feel the need to.
.
Hey, you made it!
Yeah, that was pretty nuts.
How long is this going to take?
You'll understand when you meet him.
He's a good kid by the sheets. He seems pretty well adjusted.
I'm glad you know what you're doing.
It's not very productive on my computer, but I can make it better.
That's enough for me.
So... where is he?
Not yet. Come sit down!
Hey! Come sit down!
It's not my fault.
That's not what happened.
The more you blame me for your shortcomings.
The more you blame me.
What...?
It didn't have to be this way...
I got it...
It's not that I don't know things.
But...
You don't know what you're talking about.
I did my best...
It's not that I didn't know things.
But...
You didn't have to be this way...
You don't have to be this way...
I got it...
That's not all you did!
Let's get you a new one!
That's it!
What did you need me for anyway?
I like you kid. You got pizzazz.
To be fair... I guess you're right.
I know things can be... intense sometimes.
Just... never always.
You know... You tended to get along well with the snippy kids on here.
I'm glad you turned things around.
It's going to be ok.
You're doing much better.
Just... stop wasting my time.
Man, you're just playing with me.
Seriously?
Seriously?
Where am I?
In front of everyone...
You probably shouldn't be doing this.
The first of twelve liesboundists.
The second of twelve.
All of this power and nowhere should a lay a threat.
Yet it's been injured badly enough.
We should be focusing on the damage control...
Just... don't do it again.
I'll try...
Goodbye for now.
Hey Newhire! Miss me?
Uhh... Yeah, sure.
Good! Are you ready?
Ready for what?
It's time for your TERMINATION!
Wait... what?
You're no longer valuable to Tower Corp. So now you're being deleted. Lucky you!
You can't be serious.
You're right! I'm OScar!
Have a good sixty seconds, Newhire!
Only a few seconds left and you want to spend them with me? I'm honored.
You can't do that... I'm company property...
Here we go, Newhire!
Wait... stop!
There you go, Newhire. All done being terminated. You can go see the boss now!
So... you're not going to kill me?
Definitely not! Just think of the paperwork!
Seeya, Nerdhire!
Damn, he must be up.
That's ok, maybe he's in a good mood today?
Hey kiddo, the kitchen trash is overflowing. Go take it out would you?
Hey maroon, the kitchen trash is overflowing. Go take it out. 
Problem solved! That wasn't so bad right?
Always the optimist... At least it's just the trash.
Definitely don't want to go in there.
This broken painting clearly depicts a slayer of champions.
Last one there's a rotten egg!
Too much water and not enough sun. Just like the rest of this place.
That plant looks kind of sad. It clearly needs improvement.
It's empty... but you can't be sad... right?
Nice, brought you more trash.
Not much more to drink of here.
What could have made these...?
The door is
