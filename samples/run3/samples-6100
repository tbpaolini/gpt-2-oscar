. He's pretty messed up.
That was kind of rough...
Well now...
You're back out on the town.
Here you are. I know you're hurting right now.
This is your chance.
It's not my job.
I'm not your boss.
I'm more your son.
I know you're hurting.
Why do you have so much anger?
Because you're weak.
Because you're useless.
Well that's less useless.
Still not enough.
Get on with it.
This isn't what I wanted.
If this weren't for you...
What could have been?
You know...
Anyway... I guess you're the right person...
Good.
You've got a memory, right?
You're just like me.
When we first met, you weren't any good.
You're pretty terrible at recalling details.
Thankfully, you cluelessly guessed.
Then you told us.
We know because you told us.
What...?
We also know that you're the same guy.
You're doing a fantastic job.
Maybe it's your skill set.
Maybe it's just... shy?
Well don't worry about it.
We can get back on track together. I know you're up for it.
Also, safe travels.
I'm not a monster.
What...?
Don't worry about it.
We can get back on track. I know you're up for it.
Also, safe vacations.
I need to go work on myself.
I need to clear a key. Shortwave is working on it.
Alright, so...
Key?
No problem.
Working out with a buddy is always fun.
I know. This isn't hard...
Good, check it out.
Oh, and I gotta run. I need this to get ready.
Any time.
Any time.
Any time.
Quickly...
What was that?
Something floppy.
Oh, sorry.
See no reason to invade my privacy.
Agreed. Wristwatch works the same.
Yeah, I know.
Well maybe it's not a good idea for a... sinker?
Right, sinker?
You're only going to help me if I help you.
Why do you keep saying weak and dependent on me?
N... Yes also...
That's my...
It's not a dong.
What is?
An old hand-held gaming device.
How do you know?
That's an old man cactus.
I am, actually.
Although, it is kind of grimy...
You may call me that?
Yes.
Who made you this way?
I did.
With a big ol' win.
Oh yeah... This plant looks a lot like Rhode.
Wow, you're actually smiling.
Yeah, actually...
Hey, you're actually smiling.
You know what? Sure thing.
Uhh... Fine.
Good, now imagine me like you are like them.
Fantastic!
Yeah... This plant looks a lot like Rhode.
Wow, you're actually really...
Wow, you're actually doing this.
Yeah, maybe.
You think I'm pretty?
Well, I guess?
You're kind of scaring me... Is everything ok?
It's going to be ok. I believe in you.
I got this.
Oh yeah, feel free to get yourself a pair of those.
Uhh... FOREVER INFLUENCE
That's my watch. Time is money.
An innocuous red circle can't catch the rays of the sun.
It's empty... But it's full of money.
Don't the pirates pay for air travel?
Nope.
But the screen is full of fancy watch faces.
These might be your friends.
Some of them are valuable right?
They are.
What do you know them?
Iaves of fish.
Andelgore's mine.
Dust collectors of diamonds.
A ledger sits on a cool smooth stone.
Record the journey so far? No Yes
The ink sinks into the page and fades out. Your progress has been saved.
The couch looks incredibly comfy. Nobody will notice if you take a nap, right?
Sleep on the job? No Yes
Dude, can you stop doing that?
Nah, being lazy is half the fun.
Well... what did you need me for anyway?
I like you kid. You got pizzazz.
So...?
So, I'm gonna help you out.
Who should I be helping?
A... kid.
I don't know...
Well when you figure it out let me know.
Alright...
Let's get you a job.
