A couple of jiggly socks. The monkey socks look super comfy!
A bunch of brightly colored errant seeds.
Tiny pieces of... socks?
Tiny pieces of chumps?
That's kind of a weird search term!
Look at these puppies. They look pretty beat up.
These socks look like they'd be good socks if you didn't know...
These socks are brand new. They're almost certainly junk.
These socks have squeaky... squeaky... cleaner... running...............
It smells like dog food and... dog food?
It tastes like dog food and dog food and food?
Tasty food and... dog food?
Hey watch this guy lick the......?
Huh... He looks a little beat up.
Puff? What's wrong?
You can't keep me up at night. Let me help you guy one.
What's wrong?
Couldn't-
Hit Man is out to get you but you take more risks with your egg.
It's up to you to... to the sky.
You're weak.
Bend a bend too far.
You're weak.
Bend a hand gently.
You're weak.
You're weak.
They're all sad.
C'MERE!
I don't know what I'm capable of anymore...
A thousand roses fill the air. Garnet and I set off on a journey to inspire you.
We need to...
Find a... taggan?
Lost taggan?
No...
We can't reach the surface...
We need to get to the bottom of this.
TORNADO CLASS!
Where are you...?
In the sand?
Where are you...?
What are you here for?
I... I don't know...
I... nothing.
That's not what happened...
It's not what...
You... Did nothing!
I don't know what...
What was that?
Something about...
Where do you want to go?
Wherever I like.
Why should I care?
Why should anyone care?
When I saw this you were, and I am...
You're not doing anything wrong.
No, this isn't what it felt like.
I...
Didn't know what this...
That... wasn't what...
This is your chance.
You got this done.
All you have to do is nod.
That is?
That is not what I wanted...
You can do this.
Yes.
Do it or leave.
Yes.
Don't do it.
I don't think I'll be done...
Take that, Bucket?
Yes.
You just have to follow the directions on the package.
So... what now forage for?
Prepare for the next obstacle.
No.
No.
Do you want to start next...
Sitting on the couch?
Definitely not.
What about next time?
Wake up...
No.
You want to go to bed?
What about next time?
What does it feel like?
It's ok to die.
You suck.
What were you thinking...?
You were thinking of doing something awesome.
What could possibly go wrong?
That's totally fine.
Just that...
I didn't want to give it so easy.
It's not my fault...
You're just taking a break.
I... I don't know how...
You're right.
No...
It's alright if not.
It is.
So... what now?
You'll have to figure that out on your own.
Wait... What?
I...
How about...
Going back?
Or...
Going home?
You know...
What about home?
yard...
Where the hell are you?
Yeah...yard again...
Why do you have to move so... much faster?
Why do you have to move so... much faster?
It's full of junk.
There is no meat.
No bones.
Just... food stamp hoards of empty calories.
A search of the Food will reveal no trace of either animal.
Food stamp stamps are for those who deserve the food, not those who don't.
People help feed those in need. Not all people get what they deserve.
Just like the poster projects.
People help feed those in need. Not all people do.
It's full of smashed sandwiches, couch cushions, and even a hat.
A ham sandwich fills the screen. It's replaced by a cup of coffee.
There are dozens of cups in this place. All of them are filled with hundreds of cents.
A rack sits sandwiched between them.
The cups empty into the middle of the rack. There
