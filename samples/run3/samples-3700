This place is getting pretty tough.
All the bad memories flicker away at this point.

A bunch of weird stuff.
Not much more to say.
Maybe you're right...

A named is names carved into granite boulders.
There's a big stone wyrm on the side. "It's Lore".
Hey, it's Lore.
It's not even a monster.
I hope so... It feels good.
Check the cabinet for a wood block.
The wood fragment is too valuable to pass up.
It looks like a slab of bedrock.
What kind of discovery is this?
Take the fragment and bring it with you.
New construction projects call for large blocks of this wood.
Aren't you tired of looking at these things?
Are you looking at something overpriced?
These projects are too stressful to take up time.
