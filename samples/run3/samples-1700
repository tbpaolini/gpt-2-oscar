======== SAMPLE 1 ========
's gonna hurt.
Ahem... Fine. I think I know what I'm doing...
I can beat this every single night.
Is everything just a dream? No Yes
He's almost there, too... I mean, he is in person.
He feels much better. He knows what he's doing.
Our next stop? The Fish Market. What a cute little food cart.
It's a stuffed animal in a jar. Gross, huh?
Go look in the mirror. You think it's gone of its mind.
You think it's gone? No Yes
The door is barely open...
Bend youry threads? Don't you dare touch them.
Auntie Joe! I'm at the Fish Market. Let's go get your food.
Stomp on the shoe shelf! You got nothing on the trade.
Aussie mofo! You got sluts every time ya press 'T'.
Theres tons of freshly laundered inventory left.
The shelf is neatly lid...
A WHOLE GLASS. WHAT ARE YOU DOIN?!
A small bag. A couple of spoons.
Where are you?
In the rain.
Oh hey, that's kind of the upside.
That tree? That's pretty rad.
Yeah, that kinda dickamomb.
It's looking pretty beat up.
Yeah clear enough that I could clean it myself.
Looks like the torn jacket I got wasn't enough.
It's full of quested text.
I got quest points for doing my job well.
Those little words say it all.
You can't criterate the sea.
Yeah, that's pretty shitty.
I get points for chasing after harebits while they're still a baby.
That's not even my baby's fault.
You're kind of scaring me... Is everything ok?
Of course.
What... when is something doing the phone right?
Is itus? mister hela?
When I...
It's not now.
It's fine.
I'm on my way to getting my hair done.
What...?
Get it squared away.
I don't know if I agree with you.
I understand when you said it.
I hope so...
That happens.
I asked you before.
Now it's my turn.
How do I get out of here?
Follow your heart.
The first door is the least appealing.
The handle is taped... but it's all metal.
A bunch of crystals are scattered around.
Nice and cold.
Should I go under them? No Yes
Those are too strong to pass up.
There's a bunch of rings in here.
A bunch of unbreakable records.
Cracked lenses, smashed glass, or both.
A bunch of broken glasses.
There's a book written in broken glass.
It's called 'The Book of Short Term Memory'.
Put it away? No Yes
Pack it away? No Yes
Put it away? No Yes
It's full of a ton of information.
You'll never find him.
I'll keep trying.
It's not really a book.
It's just a bunch of ideas.
Nobs, elven clans, and whatnot.
Are you alone?
Nope! I'm set to make my way through The Tower.
What an adventurer, you really is devouring something such as this.
Come along then, stay away from the rest of the tables.
Hey, you made it here before me!
Looks like the clutter is gone.
Looks like it too... It's really, really old...
Ah! You're again, er, here.
��合都市・都市・都市・都市・都市・都市・都市・都市・都市・都市・都市・都市・都市・都市・都市・都市・都H All of this junk should be on something better than this.
Hey, don't go near my places.
� ok, i'm pretty good at this one.
Here's a dollar. Armadillo. You can't even beat that in a bar.
Hey, you made it! Of course!
This stove is messy.
Sleight of all things gas stove.
Mystery on this from the gas station? Why are you here?
Dark wood and sparkles in all the places.
It's a Tower of Babel block. It says things are looking up to him.
It's full of a ton of garbage.
It's empty except for this garbage.
I believe Inua...
Skilled
