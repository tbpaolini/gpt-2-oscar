?
Well, you're right. Let's get going then.
AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! Sigh...
Oh no! Don't touch the carpet... This door isn't right here.
Yeah, sure.
I saw you found a flower. What a cute looking flower.
Oh my god...
You went in the right spot?
Yes.
Oh my god...
Wait... did you get anything?
Not without my love...
Wait... what did you get anyway?
You're getting the best.
Wait, no.
I'm just playing with you. Better not get caught.
I just got... scrawny.
What...?
Oh... sorry...
Look, we can talk. What did you get?
A tiny flower.
A small... hoot...
Neat...
Looks like you managed to get a little... creative with the rug.
C'mon, buddy!
Aww, you really messed me up! Never thought I'd be so caught up in these silly things.
Totally worth the time and effort.
That's probably a lot of work keeping an eye on my 'pocket flower' shelf.
Oh yeah, another cute rug. Get a nap.
There you have it! All you did was lay there, wistfully, and quietly.
This rug looks really neat here. I've made a few other stuff too. You're probably in for a treat.
Looks like the shelf is ready!
Hey, look! I saw a bunch of neat stuff in the wash!
You're taking a nap today? Well my apologies I'm just busy wasting time with my computers.
Well that was neat. Let's go check it out.
Yeah... look what a bunch of clever ducks are made of.
Wait... what...? What's that...?
Don't worry this is going to stick! I have a bunch of neat stuff for you. I mean, seriously.
What?! You don't have to be so clever to keep making stuff!
Welp, just need to get you stuff...
I think I caught some ducks. They're pretty rad anyway.
I mean... yeah, the shelf is getting tough so let's get going buddy.
Duck huh? What in the world is going on down here? I mean, look at the shelf.
Wait... what? I want ducks. I mean, I'm a big fan of ducks.
Seeya tomorrow guy!
Oh hiiit...
He's a scrawny duck like yourself. Don't worry about it. Just don't tell anyone I've been in a fight before.
Alright, this thing is kind of dangerous. Let's just 'Buck the Duck' him. Don't worry.
Alright, this thing is kind of dangerous.. It's not... sticky...
Man... I'm not even holding anything.
Awww... this is my stuff! You got so many awesome stuff in here.
Just... take the shelf and... don't press...
That's it!
Duck yeah? That was a lot!
Yeah... maybe I'm being too generous here.
Nah! I'm not holding anything.
Yeah... yeah...
I'm playing up the shelf as well. Better see ya at the lab.
Hey! That's the price of doing business in New Hampshire. At least you got a cooler than me.
Hrm... hey I gotta talk to another guy. Hope you like what I'm doing!
Alright... I didn't mean to put your name forward. Think you'll just kind of look around?
Well, I can help... maybe I could get you some work?
Nope. Not really... I don't really have the money for that. Right now, I'm working on doing freelance stuff.
I can help you though... maybe I can have some fun?
Yeah, I can too!
This is really my thing.
Yeah, like... yeah...
Yeah... well, it's not my thing.
I understand.
So, what do you think? Do you want to go? We should probably give it a shot.
Uhhh... I don't know...
Also... think about what you're waiting for. You really could go on a pirate adventure though.
Alright, sure. All right then.
Alright, you got it.
What for?
We gotta do the housework. It looks like your dad's doing all jacked up thing in here.
Thanks, Joe!
Auntie Nellie... just one more thing... you're fired. Oof.
What?
It's like the family say in Ramallah... it's not supposed to be...
Hey! You wanted 'em?
Sure! Thanks!
The... the stuff?
A bunch of what?
You know... stuff like
