.
I don't know if I can do this alone.
CHICKEN SMUGNESS
Not on my watch!
You caught the food bird?
Yes.
A CELEBRATION, I SAY!
CHICKEN SADNESS
Wow... You're pretty terrible at this.
Like you're any better.
That was kind of rough...
You're telling me.
Not much of a haul but it'll have to do.
Sorry...
Don't worry about it.
Not bad!
Thanks!
I mean... not good either.
Thanks...
You almost made it!
Sorry...
Aww... don't feel bad. You did great!
Thanks!
I don't think I can catch it...
Well don't push yourself too hard.
Murder Joe? Absolutely not. What's wrong with a little murder?
Such shoddy workmanship on this one.
I expected better of you brother.
Time to clean up this mess...
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU WIN YOU LOSE
Oh, hey. I was hoping to run into you.
Is everything alright?
Well yeah, at least I hope so?
Uh...
So... what's on your mind?
I'm not good at this kind of thing.
What kind of thing?
This... kind of thing?
Oh man...
I don't know what to say...
Well, what are you doing...?
You found a sweaty gym sock. Exercise.
This locker is locked. Guess it takes its job seriously.
There's an old red combination lock on it. Someone carved a 'C' into the knob. It won't open.
It's full of hundreds of pairs of round glasses. They don't even have lenses.
There's a smooth metallic object in here. It's the back of the locker.
It's smashed closed and can't be opened. It looks like it took hundreds of tiny punches.
The locker stands sockless before you. It seems lonely.
Working out with a buddy makes things pretty easy.
Especially when your buddy is as quick as Chomper.
Gives me something to shoot for.
Working out with a buddy makes things pretty easy.
Especially when your buddy is as slow as Trapper. HAH HAH HAH!!!
Oh yeah? Well, I'm catching up!
IMPOSSIBLE!!!
He's too busy jogging to hear you.
He's too busy running to hear you.
The bracelet feels cheap... like painted plastic.
A deliciously painful memory is tied to that object.
Where are you...?
Wherever I like.
Well... nobody said you could talk.
Stop me then.
I... I don't know how...
Good. Embrace that helpless feeling.
Now pick up the object.
Alright...
Hold it tightly and close your eyes.
What... was that...?
Something painful. Something hidden. Gnawing its way forward.
I just gave it a little... push.
Find more like this. I want you to feel the rest.
Not enough... I need more...
Home at last.
WHERE AM I?! WHAT IS THIS?! WHERE IS BARON?!
You're safe and in my library. Enlighten me on what a baron is?
My dog... He's more than that... Baron's my best friend.
I see... I'm sorry to say things are a bit more complicated than you would like.
What do you mean? Where is he?
In a place beyond this world. I can help... but it will not be easy for either of you.
Just tell me what you know and I will do my best for him.
Just like you did for him?
Say it like what?
Say it again.
It again.
I see nothing...
You can't be here...
You hate me...
Just like you did for him?
Say it again.
It again.
Make it stop.
You can't escape your fate.
How do you feel?
I'm not ready...
It feels... intense.
You can't escape your fate.
What...?
It's my fault.
Why do you ask?
Do you really need any help?
Help...?
No... I just don't know how...
Please... Don't worry about it.
Hang in there.
They're passing by.
Take the snake off of your body.
Thought... It would hurt more...
Thinking... Biters dont have brains.
Kids say things like... 'He tasted like dog food.'...but that's no big deal.
A sickly kind of home to many soulless cacti.
There's a ledger set on these animals names.
Record the journey so far? No
