I SAID THAT'S ENOUGH!!!
Nice! That's the food journal. Good stuff.
The ink is running thin.
The next door area is too busy reading to notice the other person.
It's doing a bunch of quick maths. You can see odd numbers there.
Oh, and by the way, is there anything I can help you with?
Can't say that a computer or a phone should or can't.
Some things are known, but no known cure.
Some things are known, but no known cure.
Well, that's ok. You can't say that.
Not yet.
Wean up on the 'totaled' ability.
Couldn't figure it out then.
Good, now get it fixed.
That's a FACT!
REALITY BOARDED IT!
HOW COULD YOU ASK THEM?!
Why would you ask them in the first place?

Not all, dear.
NOT ALL OF IT!
You know what? Fine.
Good.
I know.
I just think...
Better.
Better.
I always wanted to be a viking. Got me a beard.
That was the plan...
That's exactly why I wanted to be a viking.
What...?
Get over here, dude.
Get out of here, dude.
Gotta get out of here, dude.
TODO: This should say that Short lived.
Wait... This guy is actuallyotent?
This feels really wrong...
Maybe I'm a clever person...
Well, maybe you're just a silly person.
You really don't know either.
What...?
What are you... a genius?
You're a third person action figure movie fluff.
That's pretty terrifying.
What are you talking about...?
Back before he pushed you out.
You're in my place. Good job, OScar.
Glory to the end.
You were useless and worthless again.
An empty chest.
Time to figure this one back out.
Logic told me to open it now.
True...
To my nature.
Logic told me to remove it.
True...
I'm not good at this kind of thing.
Logic told me to leave it alone.
True...
et nachme stags...
Terribly disappointed.
Reached its maximum potential.
You know what they look like.
Yo hand him that sweater... He looks nice.
No...
Wanna fight about it?
Y'all kids make me feel like I have everything...
Comparing apples to bears is like... more research into your goals.
I'm not mad at you for how you handled this.
It's just that I don't think it's very ideal.
You.
Hayato.
I'm sorry to say that your problem has now been solved.
It's just a matter of time.
I guess you're right.
I know.
Even if you thought you could do better.
One day you will.
I will be right there with you every step of the way.
What... you're too old to face this challenge alone.
What... you're still here?
Happier... Not You.
Still not ready.
You'll see soon enough.
You just need to be realistic about it.
Dang, that.
Can't do this... I'm busy.
I mean... I am.
What...?
Always been the way... Always gonna be.
This is how it should be.
So hesitant.
Yet you made the right choice.
This is what works?
We can get back on track together. I believe in you.
So that motivation helps you go after the same goals?
What do you need?
Destroying this house? That's just rude.
That's not what happened.
You're right.
I'm not stupid.
What...?
You're not even close.
Yet you stuck your head in.
You had your chance.
But you didn't stick out.
You just didn't change your mind.
That's not good management.
You're right.
I'm not stupid.
You're usually right.
Just out of habit.
This won't work this time.
Newtons.
That's not
