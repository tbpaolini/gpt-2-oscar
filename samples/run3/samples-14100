======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 you're not scared.
Don't worry about what happened here.
I'm sure you'll be ok.
You sure?
I said don't worry about it.
You sure?
I said don't worry about it.
You sure?
I said don't worry about it.
You sure?
I said don't worry about it.
You sure?
Wait... what?
You sure?
Oh yeah... don't you?
That was close...
Though... not close enough.
You're right...
You're starting to understand.
They are only here to hurt you.
No, I don't think I can bring myself to be friends.
Let's be friends then.
Can't do anything about the rest.
Leaving the club.
Well, OScar did say you can.
Thanks...
I Don't Bestow Two Pecks on You.
A Delicate Salty Hotdog That's a real ol' tail.
A Baby Baby of a Lunchroom.
A Haunting Lunch Box.
Well, that's not what I wanted.
You're kidding.
No reason to remember her NOW.
What are you talking about?
Back before he pushed you out.
This is your fault. You're trying to blame her.
What...?
Why do you need to know?
Why did you lie?
Why did you lie about Rhodes feelings? I wanted to stay out of it. I wanted to know more.
It's not that I wanted to lie...
I just don't know either of you well enough to say anything.
I didn't want to give you bad advice.
You seriously have nothing to say?
Just... give me a minute.
Fine...
What about when I helped you?
What do you mean?
You asked me if you should follow your heart.
I told you it was a good idea.
Yeah well...
You should have stuck with your gut.
My gut?
Yeah dude. You were right... You told me to go with my heart.
But then you second guessed yourself...
Of course I did.
I don't know you, or Rhode. At least... not really.
How could you expect me to help you?
You know... you're not wrong.
You also kind of suck.
What...?
When we went to lunch you didn't help at all.
You just sat there dodging flowers.
Then you told me you wanted to fail.
Well maybe I did.
Well maybe you suck.
And now I'm dead. So maybe everything sucks.
It's all fun and games until the deer hits the fan isn't it?
Are you... really dead?
Yeah... I guess?
If I'm not then what is this place?
Like, look at those things.
The heck is that? Honestly...
I try not to think about them...
Yeah... maybe that's for the best.
When we went to lunch you didn't fill a single basket.
Yeah and I told you it wasn't my fault.
You try catching a bunch of stuff with a basket on your head.
Huh... I never thought about it that way.
Well maybe you should start.
Yeah and you said not to!
Yeah well...
Yeah well nothing.
You made that choice.
You told me to do this.
You chose to listen.
What...?
Why do you need someone else to tell you who to love?
Why is that my choice?
I...
Look...
Maybe I lied...
And maybe I feel bad about it...
Maybe isn't a great answer here.
Well... maybe is all I've got right now.
Hey look...
All of this...
It's just a lot.
I'm sorry, bud.
I'm sorry too...
It's water under the bridge.
Uhh... bad analogy considering how I went out but you get the idea.
So like... time for the hard part right?
Yeah... feels like it.
Well then... here we go.
Is this how you wanted things to go down?
Is this what you wanted? I want to fix this. You deserve this.
Wait... really?
Yeah... this isn't right.
Well if that's how you feel then I know you can do it.
Hey... pretty sure it's too late for me.
But there will be others...
Help them...
Turn this whole thing around.
Good luck out there.
You know...
Never thought I'd say this but...
I'm glad.
I wouldn't want to spend my life...
Knowing someone like you was out there anyway.
Imagine where things would be...
If you had only stopped at one.
Here to watch usfall.
