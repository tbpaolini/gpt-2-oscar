Definitely more direct...
Try not to touch him again.
He's already finished talking to you.
In fact... talked me back to myself.
Good luck out there.
Time is money.
Don't give up.
You'll always be poor.
I know you are.
We've both been horribly wronged.
This cannot be happening.
We can't find any...

-are you sure you don't wish to go?
-No, I want to go!
I currently have no intentions of returning, my name is Tobias.
-What...?
If you do, I will make sure of it.
-Then, who throws a stone?
-The people who choose to stay out of it is only right.

Well then, let's get going.
Who is this?
Don't worry about it.
How do you know I'm not dead?
I... I just happened to come by your place.
I'm not mad at you for what you did, sweetheart. Just don't tell me you caught a glimpse of it.
I never did.
Then how come you never told me your plan?
I just know you'd do something awesome after it.
Wait... really?

You're wrong.
It's the first time in a while I feel this way.
I should have listened to you.
I should have paid more attention to what was going on.
I just got so wrapped up in work that I forgot what it meant to be a dad.
I let you down.

I... I get it...
Didn't realize until now...
You're right.
I got stuff going on.
You got stuff going on.
... I don't want to mess that up.
I just need to know that's it.
So... what's on your mind?
I'm not good at this kind of thing.
OH NO!
....
OH!!!
OH!!!
I don't know what you're talking about...
I just don't know anything.

There are hundreds of emails in here.
A thousand.
Here's the deal.
I don't know anything about you, Short Circuit.
