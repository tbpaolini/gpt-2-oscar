======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 this isn't real!
You're faster than you look!
I... what...?
Are you alright?
Yeah, sorry... Just kinda phased out for a minute there.
Don't worry about it. We all deal with things in our own ways.
So... what are we doing out here?
Hunting.
Hunting for what exactly?
For a very rare and... tasty looking creature.
You don't say...
I do say.
In fact... I'm looking at it...
right...
NOW!!!
ENRAGED CLUCKING
WHARRGARBL!!!
There it is...
Wait... what?
Grab the food pods... Before it escapes...
Food pods?
RUN, YOU FOOL!!!
It's been busy.
You again...
This one knows us, dear brother.
It may not wish to, dear sister.
Well, you're right about that.
How unfortunate for it.
We shall see.
In time.
I don't need your pity.
Hello again, little one.
You again...
It recognizes us, dear sister.
It matters not, dear brother.
You don't get to decide what matters.
It has passion.
Without conviction.
We shall see.
In time.
I don't need your judgement.
It has fire.
Yet no spark.
It will not survive.
There are other trials.
There are other cycles, dear sister.
You are correct, dear brother.
Burning with passion.
Yet without control.
It may yet hone the blade.
We shall see.
We shall.
An overwhelming desire to succeed.
It showed a mastery of form and function.
An aptitude for agility and grace.
Will it continue?
We shall see.
We shall.
That's enough.
Enough?
Definitely not.
It wanted more.
It dug into her life.
It gained nothing and helped no one.
That is not for us to decide, dear sister.
Perhaps, dear brother.
Enough?
It lied to her.
It concealed information.
This benefits no one.
It may yet help her.
It kept her from the path.
That path led to nowhere.
We are in disagreement, dear sister.
We agree on one thing, dear brother.
Another powerful response.
Backed up with compassion.
There is no compassion here.
It helped her find the path.
The path she's on leads to nowhere.
We are in disagreement, dear sister.
We agree on one thing, dear brother.
Enough?
It told her the truth.
Then it is weak.
Honesty is not a weakness.
Then it has limits.
All things have limits.
Not all things, dear brother.
All things, dear sister.
You're not listening to me.
It demands to be heard.
It begs for attention.
A natural response, dear sister.
We cannot speak on its nature, dear brother.
We will, in time.
We will.
Yet it pushes others into isolation.
An ideal unknown to us.
The thought has appeal.
You overstep, dear sister.
My apologies, dear brother.
You know what? Fine.
I'm sick of you wasting my time.
Hurt them.
Make them pay.
Make them pay? You don't have to do this. Don't let it control you.
Make them pay? Yes  Yes 
It is denying the influence.
This vessel holds promise.
A foolish mistake.
This vessel is not ready.
Shall we test it?
In time.
Until then...
Farewell, little one.
Don't give up.
You can beat this.
Time to wake up.
GIVE UP GIVE IN GIVE OUT
So now you want to hang out?
After all of this?
You can't be here...
You hate me...
Just like you hated her...
Why are you here...?
Haven't you done enough damage already?
I...
You what...?
You want to be friends?
Let's be friends then.
C'MERE... BUDDY.
What's wrong?
Am I not being a good enough friend?
Don't worry... I'll try HARDER.
Haha... now that...
That wasn't very NICE.
You're hurting me.
You're always hurting me...
That's what REAL friends do though...
Right?
Is this it?
Is this what it feels like?
Are we BEST friends now?
STOP!!!
I won't let you hurt me.
I won't let you hurt anyone.
NOT NOW!!!
