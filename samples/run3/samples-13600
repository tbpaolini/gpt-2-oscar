 way.
So everything is fine?
Yeah... I guess... It's just a dream...
eww... You appeared before our hero?
Huh...?
Undeath the page I noticed a faint mist.
A soft note instructs you to speak to it.
Hey... if you can't speak to it let me know.
fieldtivist Don't speak to anything
Definitely don't want to give in to anything
This long ago left us nothing.
Nothing to see there.
It's a chest.
Nope definitely not.
It's a bunch of tiny mudshallow places.
These aren't anything like what we would need to place food crops in them.
No food crops found!
None of this is ever going to look good.
The camera goes off the screen.
What kind of monster made this?
A bunch of strange looking snacks.
Sneak a treat? No. Spam is not a good look for us.
There's a small ant farm in here.
They look rather industrious.
There is a small ant farm in here.
They smell like sawdust?
No. Instead they smell like fancy coffee.
A small ant farm in here.
They smell like fancy chocolate? No.
A large ant farm in here.
Double doors do not mean big!
There are a bunch of people in here.
They're all over the place.
It's all cute and quiet.
The night is getting rough.
Not your time! Keep going!
I'm your champion.
Your time has come up short.
I know you're in need of a fight back.
JUST STOP!!!
Or what?
Or...
Or you will blame me?
Just like you did in the movie.
Oof...
You're too cute for this.
Or you will give up?
Just like you did in the movie.
Of course...
Just like you did in the cave.
OWH...
HOLY HOT HECKIN' DANG!!!
That's not what I sa...
You alright?
Yeah, sorry... Just thinking about something.
Your friend Baron I take it?
How was that?
Don't worry about it.
Ack... what did you need?
Emelio...
What did you need?
Someone to look after me when I got up.
I guess you're right...
Look, I'm sorry I didn't mean to.
I'm sorry, it's not something I'm proud of.
What do you mean?
You really couldn't stand up to me.
Well when you're not taking care of those around you.
Why are you apologizing?
Why did you lie about Rhodes?
I mean... I did.
I apologise...
It's time for me to clean up this mess.
What should I be doing?
Watching as you deal with the aftermath.
As you come to terms with this aftermath.
Where do you think you're going?
You can't be here...
What should Rhode do? Watch as you decide.
Towards the end of his term.
A mess.
You'll see that by the time he's finished.
Tell him what?
He can fix this.
Goodbye for now.
Hey Newhire.
You know, you're always doing this.
I'm glad to see new people.
What do you mean?
Caring about stuff isn't bad.
You know what...? Fine.
We shall see.
In time.
I don't need your pity.
Hello again, little one.
You know, you're really in the right place.
You're kind of scaring me...
What are you looking at?
Getting ready for a Viking LARP.
I'm not going to run into you.
You're not going to catch a minute of his...
No...
GET HIM!!!
You scared the heck out of me!
I don't know what you expected.
What did you want?
Some kind...?
ACNO-TEMPC AMOUNT!!!
You scared the heck out of me!
OH!!! How about a beard?
This is ridiculous.
These aren't beardtables.
These aren't beardtables.
These aren't beardtables.
Of course you did.
You can't change what happened.
Just give up.
Hey kid, wanna see a magic trick?
Well do you? Yes No. I hate fun.
You know what? Sure.
Sick, check this out.
FUZZY PICKLES!!!
Well that was definitely... magical.
Nah.
You're boring.
Nah.
He hurt you again.
Hurt him back.
How do you
