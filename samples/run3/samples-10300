It's not too late to turn this around.
I believe in you.
It didn't have to be this way...
You didn't have to be this way...
I'm glad you turned things around.
It's going to be ok.
You're doing much better.
Keep going.
Everything's going to be ok.
You got this.
I'm not mad at you for how you handled this.
I just know you could have done it better.

Why do you hate me? I hate myself.  I don't hate you.
Why do you hate me? I don't hate you. I hate myself. 
I never did.
Even with everything you've done.
All that pain and sadness just made me stronger.
It helped me to deal with people like you.
People who hate themselves as much as you do.
NO... STOP... YOU CAN'T DO THIS!!!
I forgive you... Mom.
Good. You should.
Feed Baron? Viking Feast Garbage
Oh, sorry I didn't mean...
You're the Newhire I presume?
Yeah... I guess?
Good, I've been expecting you.
Expecting me...?
Step over here. Don't be shy.
There we go, much better.
So... what do I have to do?
Stamp each letter as it arrives.
That's it?
That's it.
Alright, I can do that.
Good. I'll be attending other matters. Do your best.
Maybe this isn't so bad.
This place.
These people.
The comforting repetition.
No surprises.
Nothing hidden.
He always loved it so much.
Too much.
I guess we aren't very different.
No... I shouldn't be doing this. I need to go find him...
Well I mean, you should... but, that doesn't mean you will.
You again?
Me again!
Time for a new job!
Time for a new job... again!
Wait... really?
Well yeah... I mean you just kind of walked away from this one.
What if I happened across Baron?
What if I was taking a break?
What if I saw that glowing stone?
That's not what I wanted?
Well I mean...
You did...
You didn't stop him yet.
I don't know what you wanted but...
I don't know what you wanted.
Some things are done...
She was blinded by fear while she worked at the forge. It's her choice.
It's her right?
I expected your opinion to shift while you worked on her.
You're right.
I know what you're doing.
I just have to decide what's more important?
I work here every day.
I can assure you.
It's not the best but it is super helpful.
Is it really?
Of course it is.
What do you think I can do about it?
Look, I know I can't always choose but...
That's the problem with self indulgence is that you choose when it's right for you.
Give me a minute.
Fine...
What about when you worked on her?
What do you mean?
We've been friends for a really long time and I feel pretty good.
I'm not smarter than you are though.
You're fine.
I don't think I can catch it...
Well don't push yourself too hard.
Murder Joe? This place isn't that dangerous.
If you had only stopped at one.
Oh, sorry...
Don't worry about it. My withered hammer is still warm.
Yeah well, you're right about that.
Don't worry about it. I can fix it. You're right about that.
Alright, well, yeah I'm glad to hear that.
Yeah well, you're right about that.
Alright, well, I'm not getting any bigger.
Digging the brooding thing you got going on.
Get it...? Digging? Because I'm a monster.
She's not real.
You're the BEST!
Sorry...
Don't worry about it. My claws are super useful.
Hey, you can do that again.
Sorry...
Aww... don't feel bad. You're the BEST.
Thanks!
I mean... not quite as good as you make out.
You're kind of scaring me... isn't there a tag on that?
Always scare me.
Just give me a moment.
I'm still not at the edge...
Just know you can go both ways.
You got this.
Take the edge off.
Man, you're like, really bad at panics.
