======== SAMPLE 1 ========

A lot has happened here.
I have been made whole.
You have lived.
Heaven is like a mirror to everything I know.
It's full of sad, broken, and sad novellas.
There is a Heartbound Sparx Saga here.
It's full of earthy wiggly flowers.
It's full of a nasty looking flower.
I see you've met the bookworms.
I also know where you're going.
Don't worry about them.
They are adversaries.
You can't win against them.
They will not abandon you.
Do your best.
It may yet turn up.
We are in disagreement...
That is far from certain...
We do know we can and will handle them.
So help us God!
Thanks for what?
No thank you.
Good for Buddha.
Good for the world?
Not for the world either.
Good for both of us.
Good for both of us.
Good for both of us.
You know what?
I'm not that skilled with my secretions, asshole.
You're right.
I am though...
know when you're missing and how!
So help me God, help me Mars!
Sleight of the warrior?
No.
Your grace and understanding of the situation make me the judge.
My judgement is husbandry.
You're right.
I am.
You're wrong.
What do you mean?
I meant...
hostility?
Definitely.
However, I did mean not actually loving her.
I did not mean to hurt her.
I did not mean to hurt anyone.
I just now came across a strange device.
A tiny book!
Filled with what looks like garbage?
There's a bunch of trash in here.
Might be a fun night!
Nice! Here you go!
I hope you found what you were looking for.
Nice! Here you go!
I need to eat lunch but everything is under control!
Looks like the power is still on. That's good at least.
Staring at the garbage is much harder than I thought.
You might want to keep an eye on your food. -Not the cafeteria...
Just in time for the new year!
Principal Good will be attending to you after all.
Go, principal.
Yep, I'm out!
Well, I'm in!
That's good for.
Hunger.
Not looking after myself.
Not eating to order.
Not enough energy to use at the moment.
Not enough food to feed myself.
Needless to say I need your help dealing with the garbage.

Enjoyed some silly boardgames.
Game jams are for kids where you can have a little jjm and not have a ton of fun.
Cards are going away down the middle here...
Seriously, hang out if you can! It's free here...
It's full of obscure languages like lly and llyannon!
A bunch of bubble baths are having a cup of coffee in here.
They look rather nervous.
Although, given how bad things are at the office.
You can usually find them during your stay here.
The programmer on the right is looking reasonably well over his high school graduation, and his name is Aaron.
No one else is looking.
Probably a good time is had here.
A worker picks up a pickax at a cafe.
Wait, what...?
