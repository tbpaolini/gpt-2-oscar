======== SAMPLE 1 ========
Everything I asked you for.
Thank you.
Not the best for jokes, dear, but hey, that's what matters.
Hrm...
You know...
Don't worry about it.
I did ask you for advice, dear.
It's nothing personal.
You seriously have no idea who I is?
Don't worry.
I did ask you for advice, dear.
It's nothing personal.
You kidding?
Yep!
Well yeah, that's why I'm here.
What about now?
We better get going then then because we both know it's not over soon.
Nope...
You again?
Hey DONE?!
Yeah, yeah. What did you want to ask me?
We got what coming out like...
Seriously...?
Y'know... You're just playing with me.
Well yeah... Yeah what.
I think we should start now.
We're in favor of it.
Yeah really?
Yeah... Maybe you're right.
First row on the left. Don't be late!
Oh come on! Let's go first.
Oh snap! Oh! You're diving!
There's a bunch of ducks in here.
Duck after duck. Something them butt...
They're scaring the hell out of me.
I feel sorry for them.
Not my fault they're this way.
They aren't... I don't know what they are.
What...?
You did. I didn't want you there.
What about her?
What did you?
She deserves respect.
You know why.
Everything you did here.
You were just talking trash.
Just showed her your...
She didn't have to be this way.
You're right.
I'm sorry...
Good, now that you know I'm not your enemy.
What do you mean?
You really wanted to hurt her.
I shouldn't have done it...
Why would I want to hurt her?
Why did you just lie about what I wanted?
It's not that I wanted to hurt her.
Maybe I should have listened to you.
Maybe I didn't want to listen to you.
You've changed.
Not everyone who comes in here likes them.
Not everyone who comes in here likes me.
Youh... You're alright.
Yeah well, that's just...
You know what...? It's just...
You don't know what to make of that.
Just looking at you lately is all you got going on.
You know...
I don't know...
Hey, you're wrong.
I don't know what to make of it.
Everyone likes to see them.
Maybe you're right...
You probably are.
But I don't know anything about it.
Well maybe you're right...
Maybe I don't feel like fighting back.
Yeah well, that's just...
You know...
Hey newhire, you might want to think twice before doing anything.
Youkai don't favor members with long arms because of things like paranoia.
Yeah well... Youkai don't favor members with short arms because of things like fear.
Think twice about going door to door.
On your own.
In your own ways.
You're right.
You really do hate me...
Well maybe you should start.
What if she doesn't like me?
What if she does?
What if she doesn't feel the same?
I... I don't know?
That's kind of...
.
 ...Damn.
Good question! First we have to prove we're the same.
Second... we always are.
That's a pretty good outlook on things.
On our fourth and final piece of work we are.
We are all related apart to become better.
One day we'll all be brothers.
We all wish we could be.
One day we'd all be friends.
There's a cold silence here.
You can't hear him.
You're not close.
He's out to get you.
It's not his place to hear you.
You're always safe at the library.
Even if you come across wildlife.
No matter how busy you are, I always try to get ahead.
Getting by on the rent isn't bad.
It's because of The fact that you're male
I in the early stages of regeneration
Things are looking up for us.
 Passion
Just like you.
Who else?
No way it could feel that way.
Just look at you.
The dresser is out of batteries.
We lost a phone call today.
We'll never find you.
We know you're important.
Getting ready for the season.
What do you need me to do...?
Ready for the season yet
