======== SAMPLE 1 ========
......
Oh come on, Lore. What is it?
I just need this for... something.
How do you define valuable life?.
Well, I'm a computer programmer. What kind of a job does one?.
You're a bit harsh... but not all that nasty.
Sometimes a little harsh is enough touble reason in my book.
A tiny part of me wants to hear that.
A small part of me wants to hear what I think about this.
A small part of me wants to hear what I think of you.
That's it, just give up.
You thought longing a bit?
Well, I'm off to explore a hidden gem of a mine.
You thought you'd have a bit more?
Well, I'm off to explore a bit of a dark mine.
With a bit of planning I could get myself a hot stone.
What could go wrong?
You could always try the furnace.
What if I don't have a bit?
Then I'm not a bit person...
Then...
Then why do you need a bit of a bit of a bit?
N... testing?
You want to be as good as possible?
Yep! I mean, you are obviously not a bit person.
You want to be better?
Well... I need to figure that out.
Oh wow, look at how stressed out he is.
He's taking a break from work to chat with his dog.
He's taking a break because he can't get a job.
He's taking a break because he can't get a bone.
He's taking a break because he can't get a wink.
He like talk a little bit?
You know... I never thought...
He's pretty terrible at it.
Maybe he's not as terrible as you think.
Hey, you make me look good.
Pretty sure you know what I'm doing.
Hey, you make me look good.
 You made me feel good...
Pretty sure you're doing the same...
You can't change what happened.
Everything you did was for the best.
You sabotaged my dream...
You did everything in your power to keep me from getting a dream job.
Just like you tried to get me from the get go.
You told me to do this.
And you honestly thought I could do it?
I believe you.
Why would you give in to great urges?
Why would you give in to nothing?
You're a disgusting waste of time... I say... resources.
Oh hey, you brought them.
You're in your fifties... What a cute little thing is here?
Oh... Sorry... I can't talk right now.
Wait... you did?
You're not using these as props.
Couldn't be me...
I'm sure you are.
Seeya!
Hey, do you want one?
Can't be you...
Look, I know I've got my share...
This is not my cup of tea...
No...
I think I'm close...
Shall we go then?
We are meant to share a dream.
No...
I don't think I'm ready.
I hope you'll see this opportunity.
We can improve if you don't.
It's not my place to do so, dear brother.
It must be over here...
Poor me. I'm going to have to look... elsewhere.
Shut up...
No more... silence.
You're awake.
You know what? Fine.
I'm sick of you wasting my time.
Hurt them.
Make them pay.
Make them pay? You don't have to do this. Don't let it control you.
Make them pay? Yes  Yes 
It is denying the influence.
This vessel holds promise.
A foolish mistake.
This vessel is not ready.
Shall we test it?
In time.
Until then...
Farewell, little one.
You will understand when it's over. This is for the best.
That will not happen. Not now not yet.
We can fix this.
Well that's about the best I can do fer now.
Is he gonna be ok?
Well, it'd take a miracle. Thankfully I'm a miracle worker.
A modest miracle worker no less!
Quiet you.
Hehe...
... Look he's moving!
Told ya! Miracle worker.
No... No please... I can't do this... I can't fight you...
Oh calm down ya big baby. Yer safe here in my house. The names Cirsi!
And I'm Ramul. We can totally be friends and stuff!
You're late for work, kiddo. Mail ain't gonna deliver itself
