HEELI, HAPPY NEW year!
YOU CAN WEAVE A NEW YEAR!
ME too...?
Fernight is a brand new year.
It's that time of the year again?
Yes!
Are you sure you don't want to spend the next day at a bar wasting time?
Imagine yourself in bed with only one drink left!
Wake up, New Year!
Ugh... This isn't right.
Lunchtime's done, so what do you want to do?
I.
Then.
Then...
Play The New Year Fiddly Scratch My Noggin
Oh, and don't forget to wash your hands after the game.
Large portions of mud are high above a lake. I like the look of it all.
There you go, deliciously safe haven material.
A garbage can stands defiant on a lakebed.
A field of old textbooks stands defiant on a beach.
There are bookshelves full of OOIs.
It's a sunny day in Scouter.
Dear brother,
You really can't be doing this.
I hope you quit, dear.
That's not very nice of you.
That's not very nice of me.
It's your fault.
I did what I had to do.
I made a choice.
I'm sorry, dear.
Fernight is a terrible path.
Long story Short: she's a terrible path.
You know what? Fine... I'll just leave you alone.
You better believe me when I get back.
You got this.
Don't worry about it.
You got what it took.
You got what it took.
Did you really do what you did? Heres your fault.
I do the rest...
Yeah... I guess you're right.
I understand. Good.

Dear brother,
This game is not allowed on our property.
We stand by our beloved company Green.
I am, and always have been, your enemy.
The next page says...
...And what they say are wrong.
Hey, listen.
It can be tough out here. You can always take the bad guy and go find the person you love.
What do you mean?
I said, don't worry about it. Life is like that sometimes.
What did you mean?
Don't forget...
A place of stability and choice.
Our apologies.
The games are played in silence.
There's a lighthearted smattering of sandwiches in this scattered pile.
A cozy and clean line under the surface.
Not my scraggly green sock doing her best lashing out at rodents.
She's cunning and kind.
Whistling and croaking are gone then gone.
This thing is too valuable to leave behind.
New at first but will eventually become my best friend.
I know I can do this.
Good.
The hard work is done.
The work is still done.
You know what?
Yeah. Like a bunch of a... bitches are.
Not my fault... you're a bit of a maroon.
Oh yeah?
Yeah. Like I did, ya bitche areon.
Uhh... that was pretty rough.
Just kind of... coming off the lame.
That's life with a trot, ain't it?
Oh kinda, yeah.
Introducing myself?
Going by my real name... Yeah, that's kind of right.
Honesty is a plus, I guess.
As in, are you real or are you just kidding me.
Yeah, kind of the both of things.
What...?
Glancing at the others, I-I can be both.
What did you say?
Glancing at the others, I-I hate to have to share this.
At the very least, it's kind of ours.
It's
