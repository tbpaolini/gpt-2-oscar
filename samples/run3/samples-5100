 give you some.
Hey!
Huh... This isn't like you could -
Hurt them.
Definitely not do this again.
Same as it.
Man, this is ridiculous.
What?
Hurt them?
AHAHAHAHAHA!!!
That's not what I wanted...
The hazard tax was kind of a pun.
You're right. I expected kinda weird.
Thanks...
I'll do my best.
However, I'm not against working in the area...
Is that all you got?
What do you need?
Nothing. I just need to know, who is this.
Alright...
Who...?
Tell me who this is.
This isn't funny.
The tax payer is.
What?
She doesn't need to know.
So what do you think I can do?
I think it's time to go."
Alright... I'll head back to the lab. Have a good day.
Thanks for your help.
Looks like the power is still on. That's good at least.
Things are looking up for our brave adventurers.
Heh, I guess you're right. Let's press on you silly mutt.
Mutt?! How rude!
That lightswitch frying must have killed the power...
Must have died while I was outside.
Must have died during the night.
Hrm...
So maybe you're right?
Maybe I'm a little too harsh...
Everyone has something that's important to them.
What do you mean?
Things that matter to you.
A mountain of cash.
A mountain of bills.
A coin chest.
A mountain of tokens.
A mountain of tokens.
All of this heavy stuff.
It's a bunch of small packets.
A bunch of tiny packets.
That're all there.
A little bundle here, but not as much fun.
A bunch of small packets here, but more fun.
They're junk mail.
An old newspaper with a picture of Adolf in the back.
Well done, Germany.
You were much better, the job.
I-It's you.
I'm not... sorry.
AT THE TOP OF THE WEB SITE!
This is the final challenge in the AT THE TOP challenge.
The world's starting to see the same thing.
It's you, really.
You can't hurt anyone else.
I'm sorry, World Clock.
INTERCEPTED TRANSCRIPT
ACCEPT FOR ENTRY
I'm in the middle of reading a terrifying book.
Huh... This can't be him.
Wait... Please tell me what he is?
I'm not this form.
Wait... Please tell me what he is?
 This path leads to nowhere.
You are in fact closer than you appear.
This is nothing but darkness.
I've overcome this obstacle before.
I see nowhere other than myself.
What kind of place do you want this?
I should have chosen a different path.
I should have chosen a different path then you.
I choose a different path.
It's always changing.
Always changing, always changing.
You don't have to conform.
I am your equal.
We are the same, you know that.
As long as you believe in me you will survive.
Even if you disagree with me.
Even if you prove me wrong.
I will make this right.
This is what matters.
Everything that passes through.
I believe in you.
You do when in doubt.
We are the same, you know that.
We can improve when you manifest.
We can improve when you don't.
I am waiting for you.
Feel free to hiss if you like.
He is weak.
You can take him as you like.
I think it is time.
You are right.
We are the same, you know that.
We can improve when you manifest.
We are strong when you manifest.
You just have to accept that.
It's time.
It can't be me.
You're right.
It's your fault.
It's your fault too.
I'm sorry, Garuda.
You're wrong.
I knew it.
You're going to get it.
It's your fault.
You're right.
We're different, you know that.
We all are when it comes to helping others.
It's your fault, dear brother.
What are you talking about?
It's your fault, dear sister.
You alright?
Huh...?
Don't worry about it.
Get over here already. I got stuff to do.
Wait... what?
I... uh...
Revealed the truth?
Yes.
Why...?
Why not just tell
