 ambition you could have brought her here instead.
I bet you call them ducks.
Not the most kind, but they're those.
Not the kind you'd want.
The clock is ready for you.
Say what you will.
I definitely said what I did.
I just... chose not to.
That's not what I chose.
That's being careful.
That's doing what?
REST COMPLETE!!!
I have a book to later read.
I love it when Tim Rivers gives you advice.
He may seem eccentric, but he's a good guy.
He doesn't need to know fancy methods to cut costs.
He may be younger than you, but you're still a pretty good guy.
I need to talk to OScar about a contingency plan.
He's more of a bookworm than a gadgetnian.
A few books and he seems fine.
Disagreements happen sometimes. Say it ain't funny. Say it ain't on the clock.
He didn't say it ain't on the clock.
You don't have to sing to motivate me.
I believe in you.
Thank you for your honesty.
I believe in you.
It's not a piano. It's a computer. A proper one.
So you're saying it's me?
I'minscribeirulous.com
All jokes aside, is everything alright?
Oh yeah... I'm totally out of gas and can't open the can anymore.
Apache?
No Yes
It's in perfect shape.
Looks like a thing. I'm trying to figure out what it means.
Kind of stressing me out though.
Maybe you're right...
Well, maybe you're just out to get me.
What is it?
You ask.
Maybe the... Oh... a phone book?
I think I just hit a freezing floor.
Yeah, maybe.
This isn't like you... It's not something I'm going to forget.
I'm glad you turned down the role.
What do you want?
I wanted to give it.
I just think it didn't go quite as planned.
That's it. I think everyone else should too.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Well I guess everyone else is mostly right?
Yeah... I think I messed up.
Sorry... I should have listened to you.
Alright, fine. I got it. I'm here.
This is...its time.
We're the same.
You know what...? Nah.
I can do this.
I can fix this...
I'm sorry...
Not anymore.
I can do this.
I'm sorry...
It's not gonna happen.
Not anymore.
It's not my place to tell me how to do anything.
I've been taught this for ages.
It's your job to decide what's best for this place.
You're right. Don't give up.
Just give it a shot.
You can do it.
You know what?
It's up to you.
Who can handle this?
My choice.
YOU CAUGHT A GLORIOUS SANDWICH FOR TROUBLE!!!
Wh... why...?
I...
It's not real...
You can't be real...
I...
I'm notish...
Its alright...
Its alright...
You knew it...
It was worth it...
Terrifying... eh?
Going back to bed seems like a bad idea.
Heh, I'm good.
Tomorrow's fight won't be so bad.
So... what do you want?
I Guess I can Do This.
Yeah...irony.
Dude, this is awkward.
You're kind of scaring me.
Am I being weird or anything?
Tch, what are you playing?
Excuse me?
I don't know.
What do you want?
I don't know what you're doing.
Tch, what are you?
You asked awkward.
What are you?
Grab that stuff bag.
Grab that stuff bag. աաաաաաաաաա .
You found a scaring book.
A strange and kind book.
A good book.
Aren't you looking at it from the other side?
It's smudged and damp.
It's beautifully written.
It's full of something nasty.
Shouldn't it be smudged?
It's full of something nasty.
What kind of nasty stuff is this?
Tiny sharp teeth.
You can't even pick them up.
Tiny sharp teeth. No sense sticking them.
You know what, maybe you should start with what you
