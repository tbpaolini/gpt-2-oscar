...
I mean... not really.
You very clearly do know this place.
I mean... not really.
You aang sucks.
He seems pretty stale.
You aang sucks.
That's kinda messed up.
Yeah...
Ever tried hanging out before?
No...?
Maybe you should check it out.
Yeah, this is super sweaty and stuff.
So... how long is this going to take?
As long as it takes.
Is it done yet?
Are you done yet?
No...
Then neither am I...
Nope.
But...
NOPE!
A couple of cacti are growing in the sand.
These cacti are super fancy.
They lack their signature bowties to really show off though.
Fancy cacti bowties only grow in the rainy season.
That's a FACT!
A couple of bowtie-less cacti are growing in the sand.
Pour the potion onto the cacti? Yes No
The strange potion replenishes the fancy cacti.
They immediately sprout dashing bowties.
You quickly pocket a bowtie. The cactus doesn't mind.
The fancy cacti stand proud in their enclosure.
A WHOLE SLED OF NOPES!!!
You know... moles can't actually see in the dark.
Yeah well, neither can I.
Do you have an endgame here or...?
Nah...
Just gonna leave this alone.
Good for you.
Second cousin booktower is really far from home.
A medium pile of books.
Oh, you're heading out?
Yeah... is that alright?
Sure, I'll just sit here working my paws to the bone for ya.
Sounds good.
Aaaaaand... DONE!
You're already finished?
I mean... yeah. I'm just that good.
Anyway... Come check it out!
Go to the other side ya dork.
What if I don't want to?
Then I'm keeping the watch.
Uh... I'm over here.
Yeah well, I'm over here.
Ya don't say...
Better leave this alone for now.
Come check it out, dude!
Here you go!
The gear mechanism should work now.
It's still not moving...
Maybe it's not TIME for it to move yet?
I mean... It IS kind of trashed.
Yeah, I guess you're right...
Well... don't give up yet.
You've got all the TIME in the world to fix this thing.
Well I mean... The hands are obviously broken.
Yeah, I just thought...
You thought you'd have an easier TIME fixing it?
Well I mean... The wood is kind of scuffed but the rest is fine.
Shouldn't it work then?
It looks like it's going to be ok.
Maybe you should give it some TIME.
Why are you like this...
Because if I was any other way it wouldn't be as fun.
True.
Also... Don't worry about the watch.
I'm sure Shelly can fix it.
Who?
What are you, an owl?
Maybe.
Anyway... Shelly lives east of the lake.
Tell her husband I said WASSUP. He hates that.
Why would I want to make him mad?
You'll understand when you meet him.
You should get going. I got stuff to do.
Oh man... I gotta get rid of this thing.
Wait... did he just... MOVE?!
Nah. Couldn't be.
OH MAN HE TOTALLY MOVED!!!
HES A ZOMBIE FOR SURE!!!
Blurgghhhh...
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!
STAY AWAY ZOMBIE!!!
I'm not a zombie.
YOU'RE TOTALLY A ZOMBIE!!!
I'M NOT A ZOMBIE!!!
Hrm... Prove it then.
How am I supposed to do that?
Logic puzzle.
Logic puzzle?
Continue this pattern... One, Two, X?
One, Two, X? Three Potato Brains Oatmeal
Huh... Alright then. I believe you.
Nice.
I've still got my eye on you though.
I can't even see your eyes...
That makes two of us.
Seriously?
Yep.
Fine... I believe you.
You do?
Yep.
Why?
If you really ate brains you'd be way smarter.
Ok... you're obviously not a zombie.
How do you know?
You wouldn't give it away that easy.
Maybe I'm a clever zombie.
Pffff... You? Nah.
One...
