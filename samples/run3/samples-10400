 He's not here...
Baron isn't even here...
Well, pretty much anyone and much, anything.
Everything is going to be ok. Just keep moving.
You can't run this time.
He's not coming back.
You've been drugged.
You again...
This one knows us, too.
It may not wish to, but we are the ones that matter.
Thought process here is terrible.
It must be replaced, bud.
I... I don't know if I can replace this myself, but at least this thing works.
Leaving the elevator, I took my time with me.
Is this really all...
I wasn't hungry, so nothing...
Is this really all...
I was too lame to think about it that way.
Agnes is standing next to you, still holding a egg.
It looks like it's been left unattended for too long.
A small figurine of a snake and a happy bird is nestled between the letters 'N' in perfect condition.
Nephews always make sausages. The snake looks silly in them.
The brothers make their money by selling the years. It's a simple yet effective way of money.
Nowadays, the world's a simple again.
Hey kid, wanna see a minute?
Think twice before doing, alright?
I'm Terry.

Are you ready?
Ready, bud?
I mean... You almost made it?
Yeah, but I felt bad about it.
You're kind of scaring me... Is everything ok?
It's going to be ok. I believe in you.
Ughh... what was that?
You got hit in the head with a frying pan.
Who threw a frying pan at you?
I should have listened to you.
I should have paid more attention to what was going on.
I just got so wrapped up in work that I forgot what it meant to be a dad.
I let you down.
You're right. You did.
I'm sorry...
Hey, do it.
I really can't do this...
Oh really...?
Yeah...
You do?
I mean... You don't always have to follow through on your word.
But then you left.
I'm sorry...
Nope.
Gotta shut up about that.
Uhh... what was that?
You didn't leave a single food bowl empty.
Nah.
Hey... thanks, Joe.
You almost made it?
I mean... You didn't leave a single food bowl empty.
Nah.
Oh... sorry.
Alright. I'll let you off the hook this time bucko.
Thanks... You made it! You make the food!
I... what...?
Nah...
I mean... You didn't leave a single thing empty.
Nah...
That's good at least...
Anyway... I'll let you off the hook this time bucko.
Thanks... You made it! You made it!
I'm sorry...
Nah...
Good. I'll get out of your way...
Hey!
Yeah, Fern?
Yes?
I'm honored.
AAAAAHAHAHAhhhh...
Where are you going?
I never expected this from you...
You...
I wouldn't put it that way.
It's not anything like home...
...but it is...
Youjan's Theme Park Staircase is a metallic red thing with a swirl of caramel colored paper flowers on it.
When you up the socks slot you'll get these socks.
You can't even wash them.
No more saloons.
Newhire has defeated the dark.
You're weak.
You've always been weak.
Are you really weak?
Magic Stone?
This thing is all frayed and tattered...
I...
You'll have to figure that out on your own.
Wait... what?
You can't mind me.
I'm not actually going to mind you.
Oh nice, have fun with the rest of your adventure.
Alright, you've seen enough.
Just give me a moment.
APHN!!!
WHARRGARBL!!!
You're too lazy to work here.
Yes... I see youwork here. I get the point.
It's like most other warehouses, but you get the idea.
Someone left some junk on the counter.
It must have been stolen from here.
It must have been stolen from here.
It's shelf is strewn with old photos.
One of them is of a cowboy standing on a dusty bench.
He looks rather tired.
A small note instructs you to say 'Irish Wristwatch' out loud.
There is a small key in the lock.
