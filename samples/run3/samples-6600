======== SAMPLE 1 ========
, and not both.
It's Ramul's pocketwatch...
It feels heavier but it weighs the same.
Something about it feels... wrong.
You know...
Actually... Don't worry about it...
Awww... come on. What is it?
Seriously... Don't worry about it.
You sure?
I said, don't worry about it.
Alright then...
I'll uhh... seeya round. I guess...
EEP!!!
You scared the heck out of me!
Sorry. I didn't mean to.
Don't worry about it. Happens all the time.
You're scared all the time?
Nah. Only when striped monsters sneak up on me.
Nah. Only when green monsters sneak up on me.
I'm not a monster...
How do you know?
Do you even know what a monster looks like?
Of course! I'm actually investigating one right now.
I don't know if that's right or not.
Did you seriously just give yourself a chance?
Nah. Only when striped monsters sneak up on me.
Wait... seriously?
Why do you think I'm out here?
Because you're working on your tan?
Ah yes... A mole getting a tan.
This monster is a regular wise guy apparently.
I'M NOT A MONSTER!!!
Then... what are you?
I'm Lore.
Like... the evil brother of that robot guy?
What?
Don't worry about it. I'm sure someone will get it.
Anyway... what do you want?
Ramul gave me this pocketwatch and I'm trying to get it fixed.
Let's take a look.
The woodwork is trashed on this thing.
The gear mechanism seems to be in perfect condition though.
Looks like the gear mechanism is trashed.
The woodwork is really nice though.
We can definitely work with this.
Great looking piece and in good condition too.
Yeesh...
That bad?
Definitely.
Is there anything you can do?
Ever tried painting a garbage fire before?
No...?
Me either. Let's do it.
So, you can fix it?
Heck yeah I can!
What do we need to do?
Here... hold onto it for now.
And then...?
Come chill with me for a bit.
Don't do this.
Get us out of here.
Chill for a bit? Like a freezer. This seems wrong.
Not sure how that helps fix this thing...
Well you won't know until you try.
You gonna come hang or what?
She's lying to you.
You can't trust her.
Hang for a bit? Like a monkey. I shouldn't be here.
I just don't see the point.
Well, yeah. That's the problem.
What...?
Take a minute for yourself.
Relax a bit.
I don't know...
It's alright to do nothing every now and then.
Just give it a shot?
You're wasting time.
We need to leave.
Give it a shot? Like a cowboy. Don't give in.
You're starting to understand.
They are only here to hurt you.
No, I don't think I'm up for it.
Hrm...
So... what now?
You'll have to figure that out on your own.
Wait... what?
Hope you find what you're looking for.
Just... hold on, a minute.
You want to chill like a freezer...?
You want to hang like a monkey...?
You want to give it a shot like a cowboy...?
That's pretty cheesy, dude.
Well maybe I'm a cheesy dude.
That's what I just said.
Anyway, let's blow this popsicle stand.
Yo, thought you bailed on me.
Sorry... had to check some things out.
No worries. Come sit down!
Hey! Come sit down!
Hm...
Err...
You're kinda in the way.
Oh... sorry.
Now we wait for this glorious cryptid to reveal itself.
Cryptid...?
Yeah! Like...
BUTTERFLY DUDE! He steals nectar in broad daylight!
LARGE FEET! His feet are huge! I mean... seriously.
THE MOCKLESS LOBSTER! You can't even make fun of it!
THE MISSING MINK! They say it's been lost forever!
THE REGRETTI! He got a timeshare up on the mountain!
FLORIDA MAN! That guy can do anything!
THE SASS WATCH! It never stops making fun of you!
MOLE PEOPLE! They're uhhh... You know... like me
