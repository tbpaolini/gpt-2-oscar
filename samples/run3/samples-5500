======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 would take you so......any... good...?
It knows what you do.
It isn't afraid of you.
You will, in time.
It's a big slab of bedrock.
It's a bit soft... Just thinking about it will at least give you an idea of the type of surface you're in right now.
The bedrock looks like this.
You could have made it this far... right?
Haha, I get it. In time.
You're right. I'm not a minute...
You're right. I will be right in time to stop you.
Time is running thin...
Man, you're so fast...
Just a few weak kicks during the entire ride.
It's always hurting.
Just... give in.
Give in, take just a little bit?
No...
Give in, take just a little?
It's telling time...
There's still time...
This isn't gonna work...
You leave empty handed.
It's your fault.
They just left me like that.
Crunchy Munchy Noises
Alright. I'm in.
What's this place named by?
Welcome to the Manor. Have a good one!
Nice!
Another one, another one.
I've been getting really cold all day. Just want to warm up before we go anywhere.
Do you want to know more? Yes No
Hey, you ok...?
Only thing I don't like about you is that you're a monster.
What do you mean?
Monster... Human... form...
These monsters don't exist.
Newhire was trying to jumpulate one when...
Newhire...
TODO: So... how long is this going to take?
Wait... you're going to ask?
You're going to ask... Honestly...
Alert me if you need help.
Alright, what's this?
This is the game console. Make an attack.
Alright...
THE BOSS IS MOVING!!!
So... what is this?
WITH VIKING POWER!!!
YOU CAN'T DO THIS!!!
I said...
Stand back.
I'm not strong...
You're weaker...
Feel free to move.
Alright...
You're weaker...
Stand back.
I'm stronger...
Feel free to move.
You're stronger...
Feel free to move.
I... I won't let you do this.
I'm sure everyone does.
I'm not a monster.
I'm a fact of life.
You are an fact of reality.
I'm not a fact of opinion.
I'm a monster.
You're ridiculous.
You hit a record for... high scores.
Let's roll!
Alright...
Another high score?
SHOW YOURSELVES!!!
More monsters!
A high score?
SHOW YOURSELVES!!!
SHOW YOURSELVES!!!
Wait...
Could it be...
Is this it?
Maybe.
Is this what life is all about?
Let's find out.
No...
That's not what happened.
They fell when we rolled...
Don't worry about it.
It's not real...
It's just a dream...
I did what any good detective will do...
We've got to find it.
Where are you?
Wherever I like.
Well... nobody said you could talk.
Stop me then.
I... I don't know how...
Good. Embrace that helpless feeling.
Now pick up the loose threads.
There... there. In here.
Off to find my own adventures.
Newhire is looking quite take like.
Not all adventures are equal.
You can beat this and I will be friends with my fave!
You're getting stronger. Don't give up.
I'm getting stronger.
He's stronger.
You're stronger...
He's not real...
You can't fight him...
You chose this.
You'll always be stronger.
I chose this.
It's your fault.
You can't change this.
You chose this.
It's your fault.
You stopped me...
You guided me.
This is what happened to me.
It's your fault.
It's your fault.
That's it...?
Shall we explain?
 Before you say anything...
What are you waiting for?
Is this what you want?
Honestly... What are you waiting for? PULL AWAY
Blunder...
I don't know if I can do this alone.
Come on! It's not my fault you're blind.
Seeya, Rhode.
You're not supposed to be here.
Get me help.
Oh yeah, some people do need help.
