======== SAMPLE 1 ========
That's what matters, Emelio.
What do we need to do?
Here... hold onto it for now.
And then...?
Come chill with me for a bit.
Don't do this.
Get us out of here.
Chill for a bit? Like a freezer. This seems wrong.
Not sure how that helps fix this thing...
Well you won't know until you try.
You gonna come hang or what?
She's lying to you.
You can't trust her.
Hang for a bit? Like a monkey. I shouldn't be here.
I just don't see the point.
Well, yeah. That's the problem.
What...?
Take a minute for yourself.
Relax a bit.
I don't know...
It's alright to do nothing every now and then.
Just give it a shot?
You're wasting time.
We need to leave.
Give it a shot? Like a cowboy. Don't give in.
You're starting to understand.
They are only here to hurt you.
No, I don't think I'm up for it.
Hrm...
So... what now?
You'll have to figure that out on your own.
Wait... what?
Hope you find what you're looking for.
Just... hold on, a minute.
You want to chill like a freezer...?
You want to hang like a monkey...?
You want to give it a shot like a cowboy...?
That's pretty cheesy, dude.
Well maybe I'm a cheesy dude.
That's what I just said.
Anyway, let's blow this popsicle stand.
Yo, thought you bailed on me.
Sorry... had to check some things out.
No worries. Come sit down!
Hey! Come sit down!
Hm...
Err...
You're kinda in the way.
Oh... sorry.
Now we wait for this glorious cryptid to reveal itself.
Cryptid...?
Yeah! Like...
BUTTERFLY DUDE! He steals nectar in broad daylight!
LARGE FEET! His feet are huge! I mean... seriously.
THE MOCKLESS LOBSTER! You can't even make fun of it!
THE MISSING MINK! They say it's been lost forever!
THE REGRETTI! He got a timeshare up on the mountain!
FLORIDA MAN! That guy can do anything!
THE SASS WATCH! It never stops making fun of you!
MOLE PEOPLE! They're uhhh... You know... like me.
THE CRACKIN! That dude never stops crackin' jokes!
THE ABDOMINAL SHOWMAN! He's got like, super sweet abs!
Anyway...
Man... this is awkward now.
Break her delusion.
Tell her the truth.
Is this awkward? Feed her lies.  Tell the truth. 
Is this awkward? No, not really. Yeah and it's really lame.
Nah, you're fine.
You sure?
Everyone has something they're into.
I guess you're right.
Well thanks, Lore.
No problem... Uhhh...
Uhhh?
You never told me your name.
It's Avocado.
Your name is Avocado.
Yes.
Like the food.
Yes.
Wanna know why?
Sure...
Because you use Avocados to make guacaMOLE.
Who made you this way...?
My parents, clearly.
You shouldn't feel that way.
What do you mean?
It's only awkward if you make it awkward.
So you're saying it's my fault?
I'm just saying it doesn't have to be awkward.
Hrm...
Yeah... maybe you're right.
I should probably stop caring so much.
It's just... hard.
This is her problem.
Let her solve it.
Give her advice? Stop wasting our time. We need to keep moving.
Give her advice? Yes  No 
That's life.
Wild, weird, and full of terrors.
Heh... You're starting to sound like Fern.
Yeah, maybe a little.
Dang, that's good advice.
The price for it was pretty high...
Yeah, it can be.
Though... maybe it's not as bad as you think?
What do you mean?
Caring about stuff isn't bad.
Caring so much that it stops you from moving forward is.
You're making a lot of sense.
You can blame Rhode for that.
She's pretty rad.
Terrifying... but yeah she is pretty rad.
You just need to be realistic about it.
Dang, that's good advice.
