 again.
You still feel sorry for her.
Not just any 'I can't handle her right now' -verse.
You're like, really bad at this.
Glacial...
She's not scary.
What are you talking about? She's not scary.
You just know she's not real.
You know what... She's real.
I guess you're right.
Good... I'm gonna hate her then.
Well... what do you want me for you?
Small keyfold case. Only one basket of veggies!
Alright... so I'm going to give you that instead.
What's the catch?
The juicier you are the better.
I'm not skilled enough to read the paper directly.
Pained Armadillo ULTIMATE!!!
Can't hear you, Intern. Come around the front.
It's too bright to talk right now. Just gonna close my eyes and relax instead.
Oh yeah? You ready to eat?
Yep. Yer not even hungry.
Alright... uhh...
You gonna be perfect!
Just know that one person I named after me will reveal themselves!
Don't worry about it. I got my hands on it.
I'm ready!
I got my proof.
Alright... so I'm going to feed you the two of you right?
Yeah... feels like a pretty good photo.
Alright... but I'm keeping an eye on you.
With your eyes closed?
Now open your eyes again.
Heh...
Something wrong?
Not at all...
Just haven't taken a minute to relax in a while.
I like to come out here when I'm stressed out.
Helps to get my mind off things for a little bit.
She doesn't matter.
Think about yourself.
How do you feel? She does matter.  She doesn't matter. 
How do you feel? Think about Rhode. Think about yourself.
They don't exist.
None of this does.
This changes nothing.
She isn't real.
Kind of stresses me out to be honest.
Really? We can go if you like...
No. It's fine...
Just that nagging sense of worry in the back of my head.
I think everyone gets that once in a while.
You know... maybe you're right.
I really think I needed this.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
So... how are you?
I'm doing pretty ok, I guess...
I mean... I think I can be a little too hard on myself sometimes.
I can too. It's tough not to be.
Really?
Of course...
It's easy to beat yourself up.
You know where all your weak points are.
You know... I never thought about it that way...
Heh... yeah me either.
Hey, you think I could ask you something pretty serious?
I guess?
So, you know Fern... right?
Yes?
What do you think about her?
What do you think about Fern? She seems pretty ok. I don't really like her.
You really think so?
I guess? We just met but she seems pretty nice.
That makes sense...
Are you ok?
You seem kinda... sweaty.
TOTALLY FINE!!!
Uhh...
I DEFINITELY DON'T HAVE A CRUSH ON HER OR ANYTHING!!!
You sure about that?
NO!
YES!
I don't know...
Well when you figure it out let me know.
Alright I do, but I don't know how to tell her.
Ahh yeah... that makes sense.
You ok...?
Don't worry about it.
What should Rhode do? Follow your heart. Better just play it safe.
She's going to get hurt.
It's your fault.
That's it.
Push her away.
Have you tried telling her?
No...
Maybe you should start there.
What if she doesn't like me back?
What if she does?
What if she doesn't feel the same?
I... I don't know?
That would probably ruin everything...
That's definitely a tough one.
Yeah...
Well, we should probably get going.
Well... we should probably get going.
Ahh yeah, time to stop lazing around.
You think Fern is done with the watch by now?
I wouldn't put it past her.
She's pretty good with her hooves after all.
Anyway... Meet you back at the house.
Sure thing.
Oh, and Lore?
What's up?
Thanks.
Yeah, no problem.
It's been busy.
You again...
This one knows us, dear brother.
